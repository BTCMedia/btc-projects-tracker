### New Assets
No new assets were added.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.7.3.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.7.3-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.7.3.jar.txt file.

*NEW: There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.7.3.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 11.0.10 and the v1.7.3 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.*

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.7.3.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning/releases/tag/v0.0.100"/>
    <summary>## API Updates
 * The `lightning` crate can now be built in no_std mode, making it easy to
   target embedded hardware for rust users. Note that mutexes are replaced with
   no-ops for such builds (#1008, #1028).
 * LDK now supports sending and receiving &quot;keysend&quot; payments. This includes
   modifications to `lightning::util::events::Event::PaymentReceived` to
   indicate the type of payment (#967).
 * A new variant, `lightning::util::events::Event::PaymentForwarded` has been
   added which indicates a forwarded payment has been successfully claimed and
   we've received a forwarding fee (#1004).
 * `lightning::chain::keysinterface::KeysInterface::get_shutdown_pubkey` has
   been renamed to `get_shutdown_scriptpubkey`, returns a script, and is now
   called on channel open only if
   `lightning::util::config::ChannelConfig::commit_upfront_shutdown_pubkey` is
   set (#1019).
 * Closing-signed negotiation is now more configurable, with an explicit
   `lightning::util::config::ChannelConfig::force_close_avoidance_max_fee_satoshis`
   field allowing you to select the maximum amount you are willing to pay to
   avoid a force-closure. Further, we are now less restrictive on the fee
   placed on the closing transaction when we are not the party paying it. To
   control the feerate paid on a channel at close-time, use
   `ChannelManager::close_channel_with_target_feerate` instead of
   `close_channel` (#1011).
 * `lightning_background_processor::BackgroundProcessor` now stops the
   background thread when dropped (#1007). It is marked `#[must_use]` so that
   Rust users will receive a compile-time warning when it is immediately
   dropped after construction (#1029).
 * Total potential funds burn on force-close due to dust outputs is now limited
   to `lightning::util::config::ChannelConfig::max_dust_htlc_exposure_msat` per
   channel (#1009).
 * The interval on which
   `lightning::ln::peer_handler::PeerManager::timer_tick_occurred` should be
   called has been reduced to once every five seconds (#1035) and
   `lightning::ln::channelmanager::ChannelManager::timer_tick_occurred` should
   now be called on startup in addition to once per minute (#985).
 * The rust-bitcoin and bech32 dependencies have been updated to their
   respective latest versions (0.27 and 0.8, #1012).

## Bug Fixes
 * Fix panic when reading invoices generated by some versions of c-lightning
   (#1002 and #1003).
 * Fix panic when attempting to validate a signed message of incorrect length
   (#1010).
 * Do not ignore the route hints in invoices when the invoice is over 250k
   sats (#986).
 * Fees are automatically updated on outbound channels to ensure commitment
   transactions are always broadcastable (#985).
 * Fixes a rare case where a `lightning::util::events::Event::SpendableOutputs`
   event is not generated after a counterparty commitment transaction is
   confirmed in a reorg when a conflicting local commitment transaction is
   removed in the same reorg (#1022).
 * Fixes a remotely-triggerable force-closure of an origin channel after an
   HTLC was forwarded over a next-hop channel and the next-hop channel was
   force-closed by our counterparty (#1025).
 * Fixes a rare force-closure case when sending a payment as a channel fundee
   when overdrawing our remaining balance. Instead the send will fail (#998).
 * Fixes a rare force-closure case when a payment was claimed prior to a
   peer disconnection or restart, and later failed (#977).

## Serialization Compatibility
 * Pending inbound keysend payments which have neither been failed nor claimed
   when serialized will result in a `ChannelManager` which is not readable on
   pre-0.0.100 clients (#967).
 * Because
   `lightning::chain::keysinterface::KeysInterface::get_shutdown_scriptpubkey`
   has been updated to return a script instead of only a `PublicKey`,
   `ChannelManager`s constructed with custom `KeysInterface` implementations on
   0.0.100 and later versions will not be readable on previous versions.
   `ChannelManager`s created with 0.0.99 and prior versions will remain readable
   even after the a serialization roundtrip on 0.0.100, as long as no new
   channels are opened. Further, users using a
   `lightning::chain::keysinterface::KeysManager` as their `KeysInterface` will
   have `ChannelManager`s which are readable on prior versions as well (#1019).
 * `ChannelMonitorUpdate`s created by 0.0.100 and later for channels when
   `lightning::util::config::ChannelConfig::commit_upfront_shutdown_pubkey` is
   not set may not be readable by versions prior to 0.0.100 (#1019).
 * HTLCs which were in the process of being claimed on-chain when a pre-0.0.100
   `ChannelMonitor` was serialized may generate `PaymentForwarded` events with
   spurious `fee_earned_msat` values. This only applies to payments which were
   unresolved at the time of the upgrade (#1004).
 * 0.0.100 clients with pending `Event::PaymentForwarded` events at
   serialization-time will generate serialized `ChannelManager` objects which
   0.0.99 and earlier clients cannot read. The likelihood of this can be reduced
   by ensuring you process all pending events immediately before serialization
   (as is done by the `lightning-background-processor` crate, #1004).

    <link href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/releases/tag/v0.10.1"/>
    <summary>We're pleased to announce the 0.10.1 release of c-lightning, named by @nalinbhardwaj.

This is a *recommended* upgrade: payment secrets in invoices are now compulsory, and offers and dual funding drafts have been updated, so these (experimental) features are incompatible with previous releases!

*NOTE*: Users of the rebalance or drain [plugins](https://github.com/lightningd/plugins) MUST update, as payment secret is now compulsory.

## Highlights for Users

- `experimental-dual-fund` allows advertizement of funding rates which we will contribute to channels automatically, on a 1-month lease.
- `withdraw` and `close` (if peer supports) now supports Taproot (and other future) addresses.
- `listchannels` can now be queried by destination, as well as source.
- `plugin rescan` now automatically reloads plugins which have changed.
- We try to restart automatically if we notice subdaemons have been upgraded underneath us.
- `fundpsbt` will no longer include uneconomic UTXOs (unless `all`).
- `close` will return a stream of notifications if there is a delay in closing.
- Unilateral close feerates were reduced from bitcoind's &quot;2 CONSERVATIVE&quot; to &quot;6 ECONOMICAL&quot;.
- Tor v2 is deprecated: please upgrade to v3!
- Fixed disconnection bug when an HTLC failed.
- Fixed bug in rapid feerate changes, and make code space them out (LND compat).
- Fixed bug where Tor on different ports could be advertized incorrectly.
- Fixed various bugs to make `pay` more robust.

## Highlights for the Network

- payment secrets in invoices are now compulsory, finally closing a potential probing (or, with amountless invoices, stealing) attack.
- `option_shutdown_anysegwit` allows peers to close channels to any future segwit version address (taproot!).
- `keysend` now understands routehints, for routing to unpublished nodes, and sets the final CLTV to 22, for rust-lightning nodes.
- `invoice` now allows creation of wumbo invoices (&gt; 0.0429 BTC).
- We will now discuss old channels with peers who reconnect, even if we consider them closed.


## Highlights for Developers

- Manual pages now document *exactly* the JSON you can expect from each command (and it's tested!)
- Plugins can now publish notifications for other plugins to listen to.
- `force-feerates` allows complete feerate override (mainly for regtest), and a bug fixed where we could send 0 update_fee on regtest.
- The HSM daemon is now separated into libhsmd, which also provides Python bindings.
- `createonion` can now make variable-sized onions, and `sendonion` no longer requires `direction` and `channel` for `firsthop`.
- `dev-sendcustommsg` is now simply `sendcustommsg`.
- Many offers API improvements and updates, including unsigned offers (smaller QR codes!).

More details can be found in the [changelog](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/v0.10.1/CHANGELOG.md).

Thanks to everyone for their contributions and bug reports; please keep them coming.

Since 0.10.0, we've had 526 commits from 15 different authors over 114 days.

A special thanks goes to the 6 first time contributors:

- Nalin Bhardwa 
- Nathanael 
- LightningHelper
- OpenOms
- Urza 
- Valentine Wallace

Cheers,
Lisa, Christian,  ZmnSCPxj, Rusty.</summary>

    <summary>## Main changes

### Extract invoices from images stored on device

You can now browse the device's file system (using the device's browser, hence not needing any permissions) to load an image containing a Lightning invoice (or a Bitcoin URI, or a LNURL) and read the invoice as usual. This is useful when trying to pay someone using a QR code image shared over the internet, for example on Twitter.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.7.2.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.7.2-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.7.2.jar.txt file.

*NEW: There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.7.2.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 11.0.10 and the v1.7.2 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.*

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.7.2.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.13.1-beta"/>
    <summary>This marks the first minor release of the 0.13.x cycle. This release is primarily a maintenance release including several bug fixes that didn't make it into 0.13.0, a series of fixes for introduced regressions, and a few small optimizations.



# Database Migrations

This release does not contain any database migrations.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.1-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.13.1-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.1-beta.sig manifest-v0.13.1-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```

gpg:                using RSA key 4AB7F8DA6FAEBB3B70B1F903BC13F65E2DC84465

```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.1-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.1-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.1-beta.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.16.3`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, `watchtowerrpc` and `monitoring`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.13.1-beta
gpg: Signature made Mon 19 Jul 2021 06:04:34 PM UTC using RSA key ID 9B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot;
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker pull lightninglabs/lnd:v0.13.1-beta
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.13.1-beta /verify-install.sh
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.13.1-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.13.1-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.1-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.1-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

    <link href="https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/releases/tag/v0.6.1"/>
    <summary># Eclair v0.6.1

This release makes major performance improvements, includes a few bug fixes and several new features.
It is fully compatible with 0.6.0 (and all previous versions of eclair).

# Major changes

### Performance improvements

#### Sqlite

Eclair now uses [write-ahead logging](https://sqlite.org/wal.html) in Sqlite (#1871). WAL is better suited to our DB access patterns, and is both much more performant and safer than the default [rollback journal](https://sqlite.org/lockingv3.html#rollback) that we were using previously.
&gt; 1. WAL is significantly faster in most scenarios.
&gt; 2. WAL provides more concurrency as readers do not block writers and a writer does not block readers.
&gt; 3. Disk I/O operations tends to be more sequential using WAL.
&gt; 4. WAL uses many fewer fsync() operations.
 
This small change improves performance by more than 5x.

#### Payment Handling

Invoice generation (#1878) and handling of incoming payments (#1880) are now processed in parallel, resulting in a higher throughput under load.

### Improved Postgres support

This is the continuation of an effort to make PosgreSQL production-ready. The database schema has been reworked (#1866) and is now better organized, with appropriate types for timestamps (#1862). There have been several concurrency-related bug fixes.

We  have also added `JSONB` columns for local channels and for network announcements (#1865). All individual data fields can now be accessed from SQL and indexed, which is very convenient for advanced analysis and tuning of a routing node.

### Upfront shutdown script

This release adds support for `option_upfront_shutdown_script` (feature bits 4/5).
This feature lets you specify a closing address when you open a channel: your peer will ensure that when you close, your funds can only go to that address.

It can be useful to protect against future hacks of your node, because the attacker won't be able to close your channels and send the funds to an address that he controls. However, it doesn't prevent the attacker from exfiltrating funds by paying lightning invoices, so you shouldn't rely on this feature alone to make your node hack-proof.

This option is disabled by default, but can be enabled in your `eclair.conf`.
Note that if you enable it, the closing address will be automatically generated by your `bitcoind` node.

### Transaction publishing improvements

This release reworks our internal transaction publishing architecture (see #1844 for details).
The new architecture is more flexible, provides better logging and makes it easy to add dynamic fee bumping in the future for anchor output channels.
It will also make it easier to automatically use CPFP to ensure funding transactions confirm before the [2016 blocks timeout](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/839) is reached.

### API changes

This release updates a few APIs:

- `parseinvoice` displays Bolt 11 invoices routing hints (#1833)
- Plugins can inject their own routes into the API instead of spawning a separate HTTP server (#1805 and #1819)

### Miscellaneous improvements and bug fixes

- Eclair now uses Bitcoin Core 0.21.1 by default (#taproot)
- Eclair now supports [warning messages](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/834)
- Eclair uses additional entropy on top of the operating system RNG to mitigate random number generation failures (#1774)

# Verifying signatures

You will need `gpg` and our release signing key 7A73FE77DE2C4027. Note that you can get it:

- from our website: https://acinq.co/pgp/drouinf.asc
- from github user @sstone, a committer on eclair: https://api.github.com/users/sstone/gpg_keys

To import our signing key:

```sh
$ gpg --import drouinf.asc
```

To verify the release file checksums and signatures:

```sh
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped
```

# Building

Eclair builds are deterministic. To reproduce our builds, please use the following environment (*):

- Ubuntu 20.04
- AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.6
- Maven 3.8.1

Use the following command to generate the eclair-node package:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

That should generate `eclair-node/target/eclair-node-0.6.1-XXXXXXX-bin.zip` with sha256 checksums that match the one we provide and sign in `SHA256SUMS.asc`

(*) You may be able to build the exact same artefacts with other operating systems or versions of JDK 11, we have not tried everything.

# Upgrading

This release is fully compatible with eclair v0.6.0. You don't need to close your channels, just stop eclair, upgrade and restart.

    <summary>
## API Updates

 * `lightning_block_sync::poll::Validate` is now public, allowing you to
   implement the `lightning_block_sync::poll::Poll` trait without
   `lightning_block_sync::poll::ChainPoller` (#956).
 * `lightning::ln::peer_handler::PeerManager` no longer requires that no calls
   are made to referencing the same `SocketDescriptor` after
   `disconnect_socket` returns. This makes the API significantly less
   deadlock-prone and simplifies `SocketDescriptor` implementations
   significantly. The relevant changes have been made to `lightning_net_tokio`
   and `PeerManager` documentation has been substantially rewritten (#957).
 * `lightning::util::message_signing`'s `sign` and `verify` methods now take
   secret and public keys by reference instead of value (#974).
 * Substantially more information is now exposed about channels in
   `ChannelDetails`. See documentation for more info (#984 and #988).
 * The latest best block seen is now exposed in
   `ChannelManager::current_best_block` and
   `ChannelMonitor::current_best_block` (#984).
 * Feerates charged when forwarding payments over channels is now set in
   `ChannelConfig::fee_base_msat` when the channel is opened. For existing
   channels, the value is set to the value provided in
   `ChannelManagerReadArgs::default_config::channel_options` the first time the
   `ChannelManager` is loaded in 0.0.99 (#975).
 * We now reject HTLCs which are received to be forwarded over private channels
   unless `UserConfig::accept_forwards_to_priv_channels` is set. Note that
   `UserConfig` is never serialized and must be provided via
   `ChannelManagerReadArgs::default_config` at each start (#975).

## Bug Fixes

 * We now forward gossip messages to peers instead of only relaying
   locally-generated gossip or sending gossip messages during initial sync
   (#948).
 * Correctly send `channel_update` messages to direct peers on private channels
   (#949). Without this, a private node connected to an LDK node over a private
   channel cannot receive funds as it does not know which fees the LDK node
   will charge.
 * `lightning::ln::channelmanager::ChannelManager` no longer expects to be
   persisted spuriously after we receive a `channel_update` message about any
   channel in the routing gossip (#972).
 * Asynchronous `ChannelMonitor` updates (using the
   `ChannelMonitorUpdateErr::TemporaryFailure` return variant) no longer cause
   spurious HTLC forwarding failures (#954).
 * Transaction provided via `ChannelMonitor::transactions_confirmed`
   after `ChannelMonitor::best_block_updated` was called for a much later
   block now trigger all relevant actions as of the later block. Previously
   some transaction broadcasts or other responses required an additional
   block be provided via `ChannelMonitor::best_block_updated` (#970).
 * We no longer panic in rare cases when an invoice contained last-hop route
   hints which were unusable (#958).

## Node Compatibility

 * We now accept spurious `funding_locked` messages sent prior to
   `channel_reestablish` messages after reconnect. This is a
   [known, long-standing bug in lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/4006)
   (#966).
 * We now set the `first_blocknum` and `number_of_blocks` fields in
   `reply_channel_range` messages to values which c-lightning versions prior to
   0.10 accepted. This avoids spurious force-closes from such nodes (#961).

## Serialization Compatibility

 * Due to a bug discovered in 0.0.98, if a `ChannelManager` is serialized on
   version 0.0.98 while an `Event::PaymentSent` is pending processing, the
   `ChannelManager` will fail to deserialize both on version 0.0.98 and later
   versions. If you have such a `ChannelManager` available, a simple patch will
   allow it to deserialize. Please file an issue if you need assistance (#973).</summary>

## Running Bitcoin-S

If you want to run the standalone server binary, after verifying gpg signatures, you
can `unzip bitcoin-s-server-1.7.0.zip` and then run it with `./bin/bitcoin-s-server` to start the node. You will need to
configure the node properly first, you can find example
configurations [here](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/config/configuration#example-configuration-file).

For more information on what commands `bitcoin-s-cli` supports check the documentation, here is where to
start: https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/applications/server#server-endpoints

## Verifying signatures

This release is signed with [Chris's signing key](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/security#disclosure) with
fingerprint `339A49229576050819083EB3F99724872F822910`

Example:

```
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped

# Executive Summary

## DLC Wallet

This release merges our feature branch called `adaptor-dlc` into master. This means 
that all DLC features are now in our `master` branch.

## Installers

We now support installers for mac, windows, and linux (deb) builds. Everytime a PR is merged into master, 
we publish artifacts for that commit. For more information, please see our [website](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/getting-started#java-binaries)

With these installers, you can install the bitcoin-s wallet and start using DLCs with a rudimentary GUI.
In future releases, we will be iterating and improving the GUI user experience.

## Versioning changes

To support publishing artifacts for both mac and windows, we had to drop the leading `v` on our version scheme.
We also were required by apple to add a leading `1` to our version scheme. Thus, this release will be `1.7.0`
rather than the expected version of `v0.7.0`.

## New modules

### DLC wallet 

This new module contains all logic for our DLC Wallet

### Tor

We are beginning to integrate TOR support into bitcoin-s to for a variety of reasons.
In this release, we have added bare bones support, in future releases we will be integrating
this deeper into other modules.

## Bundle

Bundle combines both the GUI and AppServer project and bundles them together to make a standalone application.
One problem we encountered this release is how to allow users to configure their node from the GUI on first startup.

In #3142 we added support for this by adding a new configuration file that is automatically generated and written
to `~/.bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s-bundle.conf`. This file saves the user's configuration, and uses it the next
time the bundle is started.

bc79a24f532 Get both bundle and app server logging working (#3362)

2f7e5876d30 Set default neutrino peer based on network (#3360)

## Cli

42966b3cbe6 Remove logback from the cli module (#3117)

## Core

Most changes in the `core` module this release is related to optimizing adaptor point computations.
This is very important as when doing numeric DLCs we have to generate thousands of points.
We use parallelism to speed up this computation.

The other notable change in `core` is adding `DLCAccounting`. This is used to caclulate things like PNL
and rate of return for a DLC you were in.

### Assets
No new assets.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.7.0.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.7.0-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.7.0.jar.txt file.

*NEW: There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.7.0.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 11.0.10 and the v1.7.0 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.*

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.7.0.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning/releases/tag/v0.0.98"/>
    <summary>0.0.98 should be considered a release candidate to the first alpha release of Rust-Lightning and the broader LDK. It represents several years of work designing and fine-tuning a flexible API for integrating lightning into any application. LDK should make it easy to build a lightning node or client which meets specific requirements that other lightning node software cannot. As lightning continues to evolve, and new use-cases for lightning develop, the API of LDK will continue to change and expand. However, starting with version 0.1, objects serialized with prior versions will be readable with the latest LDK. While Rust-Lightning is approaching the 0.1 milestone, language bindings components of LDK available at https://github.com/lightningdevkit are still of varying quality. Some are also approaching an 0.1 release, while others are still much more experimental. Please note that, at 0.0.98, using Rust-Lightning on mainnet is strongly discouraged.</summary>

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.13.0-beta"/>
    <summary>This release marks the first major release in the 0.13 series, and the second major release of the year! This release includes a number of compelling additions including: first-class pruning support, AMP sending+receiving support, arbitrary pubkey/xpub import w/ PSBT transaction crafting, clustered lnd using etcd failover, and much more!

# Database Migrations

The `lnd` database is migrated to store all wire messages with an additional TLV field. See details below.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already:

```shell
$ curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
$ curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.0-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.13.0-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```shell
$ gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.0-beta.sig manifest-v0.13.0-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```text
gpg: Signature made Thu Jun 17 09:48:09 2021 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]

```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp

From this new version onward, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.0-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the OpenTimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands:

```shell
$ ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.0-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.0-beta.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires.

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/release.md) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.16.3`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.

They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, and `watchtowerrpc`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.
The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used.

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```shell
$ git verify-tag v0.13.0-beta
gpg: Signature made Thu 17 Jun 2021 02:25:51 AM UTC using RSA key ID 9B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot;
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker pull lightninglabs/lnd:v0.13.0-beta
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.13.0-beta /verify-install.sh
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.13.0-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```shell
$ tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.13.0-beta.tar.gz
$ GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.0-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
$ GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.0-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory.

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191):

```shell
$ make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

# Release Notes

## Database and wire changes

### Wire Message TLV Support

The wire messages sent between LN peers have the ability to carry additional data, using the TLV format. This allows attaching data and protocol extensions to messages in a non-breaking way, paving the way for future feature upgrades to the protocol.

In this release all stored messages in the `lnd` database are [migrated to a format supporting these TLV extensions](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4923), and message parsing now always read out these fields and keep them for future handling.

## Protocol Updates

### Anchor Output Channels

The spec compliant anchor channel format introduced in v0.12 is now the default channel type if both nodes support it when opening a new channel. You can read more about it in the [v0.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.0-beta), and it can be disabled by providing the `--protocol.no-anchors` flag at startup.

Since a node having channels using this format must keep on-chain funds around in case unilateral fee bumping is needed, we reserve 10k sats per channel for this purpose. In this release we [cap this at `100k` sats](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5274), and in addition avoid reserving this value for private channels.

Finally a change to breach handling has been made, to mitigate a theoretical attack the channel peer can perform by [pinning HTLC outputs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/803) on a breached commitment transaction. If we suspect such pinning is taking place, lnd will now attempt to [sweep the breached commitment outputs separately](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5036).

## P2P Gossip Handling, Hardening &amp; Optimizations

### Ephemeral &amp; Persistent Gossip Reject Caches

Those that run larger lnd instances may have noticed a cyclic nature of gossip traffic that would lead to many announcements being rejected, only to be processed hours later. This burst of traffic typically causes high CPU and memory usage, along with a large batch of blocks fetched from the node backend.

During this release cycle we dug into the issue and found that the culprit was actually a new variant of zombie channel churn: fully closed channels (funding UTXO spent) being continually offered by nodes that aren't (for some reason) pruning their channel graph.

[In this release, we'll now add channels that fail full validation irrevocably to the existing zombie index cache](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5227). Expanding the usage of this cache means that new lnd nodes will only validate those spent channels once (as they should), then never request them again during the historical sync spot checks that happen periodically.

Related to the above fix, [a bug has been fixed that would cause us to continually re-validate a channel announcement that we had already rejected](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5192).

### Dependent Gossip Processing

`ChannelUpdate` and `NodeAnnouncement` gossip messages depend on its `ChannelAnnouncement` being processed successfully. Throughout our investigative efforts above, we also noticed that `lnd` would process these messages when their corresponding `ChannelAnnouncement`'s validation failed, which has now been [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5133/).

### Improved Gossip Rate Limiting

`lnd v0.12.1-beta` featured a new gossip rate limiting heuristic in which keep-alive updates were throttled to allow one per day, while non-keep-alive updates were throttled to allow one per block. The latter heuristic for non-keep-alive updates proved to be inconsistent, especially for our auto enable/disable channel behavior, as blocks are not guaranteed to arrive at a constant rate. To mitigate this, we've moved towards a token bucket based approach to allow by default one update per minute with a maximum burst tolerance of 10 updates. These defaults may change as the structure of the network does, but they can also be changed through two new config options: `gossip.channel-update-interval` and `gossip.max-channel-update-burst`.

## Routing Optimizations &amp; New Payment Types

### Atomic Multi-Path (AMP) Payments

This version of `lnd` introduces initial support for AMP payments, which is a generalized version of the experimental keysend protocol added in [`lnd-v0.9.0-beta`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.9.0-beta). While keysend payments must be fulfilled with a single HTLC, AMP offers the ability to perform multi-path spontaneous payments and leverage channel liquidity more effectively. It also offers an initial incarnation of [AMP invoices](#amp-invoices), which helps to facilitate spontaneous payments to private nodes, and serve as a basis for recurring payments down the road.

#### Receiving Spontaneous Payments

Users can set the `accept-amp=1` configuration option to automatically accept incoming, spontaneous AMP payments. Without setting this option, all spontaneous AMP payments will be rejected. Note that this setting is not required to accept one-time payments to an [AMP Invoice](#amp-invoices).

#### Sending Spontaneous Payments

Users can send spontaneous AMP payments to nodes with `accept-amp=1` using `lncli`, `routerrpc.SendToRouteV2`, or `routerrpc.SendPaymentV2`.

When paying with `lncli`: by including the `--amp` flag, payments only need to specify the amount and pubkey of the destiation, e.g. `lncli sendpayment --amt 100 --dest 0247a5b3b2f6794da6ab930974e3396fd9973aa7dc333ea8dd3b59fb71a70165be --amp`. This will only work for nodes in public channel graph, to pay private nodes see below regarding [AMP Invoices](#amp-invoices).

When paying with`routerrpc.SendPaymentV2`: when manually specifiying arguments, setting the [`Amp`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/ad0ecc4d581f282686fa3355ac1e8f8be63cc50b/lnrpc/routerrpc/router.pb.go#L478) flag to `true` and omitting the `PaymentHash` will cause `lnd` to initiate an AMP payment. This behavior can also be forced by providing an [AMP Invoice](#amp-invoices) in the [`PaymentRequest`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/routerrpc/router.pb.go#L400) field.

When paying with `routerrpc.SendToRouteV2`: users can force an AMP payment by setting [`AmpRecord`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/rpc.pb.go#L8321) field to a well crafted [`lnrpc.AmpRecord`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/rpc.pb.go#L8513) on the route's final [`lnrpc.Hop`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/rpc.pb.go#L8280).

#### AMP Invoices

In this version of `lnd`, we introduce a new concept of AMP invoices. Having invoices at all may seem counterintuitive to the spontaneous use case of AMP, however AMP invoices will provided two necessary use cases:
 - Offering the ability to pay _private_ nodes via AMP, by providing the sender with hop hints to reach the desination.
 - In the future, the ability to make recurring payments to an invoice, e.g. subscriptions, deposits/withdrawals, etc.

Full-blown recurring invoices are not implemented in this release, but will be available at a later point. For now an AMP invoice can only be settled by one payment. That said, this release does include support for simulating recurring payments, making the existing AMP invoices &quot;pseudo-reusable&quot;.

In order to do so, users can make payments via `routerrpc.SendPaymentV2` by passing in the (AMP) [`PaymentRequest`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/routerrpc/router.pb.go#L400), and providing an randomly-generated [`PaymentAddr`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/routerrpc/router.pb.go#L393). The external `PaymentAddr` will cause`lnd` to ignore the payment address provided in the invoice, and make a spontaneous payment using the rest of the parameters in the payment request. Note that the receiver must have `accept-amp=1` set, otherwise these subsequent payments will be ignored.

The default expiry for AMP invoices is set [30 days](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/4bb6cc9cee275e7f583039ead826d0fc6f6c4c33/lnrpc/invoicesrpc/addinvoice.go#L33). Users may wish to increase this duration using the [`Expiry`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/invoicesrpc/invoices.pb.go#L148) field to further amortize the setup costs of obtaining a new invoice.

### MPP+AMP Payment Splitting on by Default

[In this version of `lnd`, MPP/AMP payment splitting is now activated by default](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5017). Prior versions of `lnd` required a caller to _manually_ specify that they wanted their payment to possibly be split via the `MaxShards` RPC/CLI flag. The default number of attempted splits is now 16 (we'll attempt to split up to 16 times by default). In addition, a new `MaxShardAmt` flag has been added that allows the caller to control _how large_ the largest split can be. This new flag can effectively be used to force `lnd` to adhere to a given maximum payment unit expressed in satoshis, which means `lnd` may split more frequently than before.

### Strict Zombie Pruning

Typically lnd will mark a channel as a zombie when _both_ of its edges aren't re-advertised within a two week period. This is typically referred to as a channel's heartbeat update. [Analysis by Conner Fromknecht demonstrated that the channel graph itself could be shrunk by ~20%](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/767) if a stricter pruning heuristic was adopted: pruning a channel once only a single edge fails the heartbeat check. [The latest version of `lnd` has implemented this stricter pruning variant](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5138) in an opt-in manner.

This new graph pruning variant is on by default for neutrino nodes as it was common for them to never actually receive a &quot;double disable&quot; of a channel's edges, meaning it would never actually remove certain closed channels from its channel graph. Routing nodes and nodes that frequently send outbound payments can activate the new pruning variant with a new flag:
`--routing.strictgraphpruning`. The new logic also requires that party that originally failed the heartbeat check to the be one that re-publishes the channel update in order for a prior zombie channel to be resurrected. 

## New M1 Release Target 

[This is the first release that includes binaries for the recently released Apple Silicon (M1) architecture!](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5034) roasbeef has switched to using an M1 machine as his primary development machine over the past few months and hasn't reported any unsafe behavior. We encourage those switching to run lnd on an M1 machine to reach out to us if any abnormal behavior is detected.

For the 0.14 release, we aim to start to remove architectures for binaries included with the final packaged release that are either in the bottom tier of downloads, or have no downloads at all.

## P2P Networking

[A bug that wouldn't allow a node to listen on an IPv6 REST port when Tor is active](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/2541) has [been fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5007).

## Wallet Enhancements

This release features several improvements that will enable `lnd` (in a future release!) to operate without the access of private keys within its process.

### Watch-Only Key Import

The wallet is now able to [import BIP-0049 and BIP-0084 accounts/public keys as watch-only](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5047/) through xpubs! This feature was made possible by the [introduction of watch-only accounts to btcwallet](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet/pull/667), our internal wallet. This functionality is exposed through two new RPCs within the `WalletKit` sub-server: `ImportAccount` and `ImportPublicKey`.

**Events (deposits/spends) for imported keys or keys derived from an imported account will only be detected by lnd if they happen after the import.** Rescans to detect past events will be supported in a future release, so make sure to use a new unused wallet when using this functionality.

[A new document was added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/key_import.md) that explains the account import and PSBT signing process.

### ECDH Revocation Seed

The revocation seed is used to generate revocation secrets during the lifetime of a channel. The [seed-generation code](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4517) has been updated to no longer handle raw private keys, using ECDH to achieve this.

### Auto-unlock wallet from password file

In automated or unattended setups such as cluster/container environments, unlocking the wallet through RPC presents a series of challenges. Usually, the password is present as a file somewhere in the container already anyway so writing an extra custom script for unlocking is error prone and tedious. Instead the [new `--wallet-unlock-password-file` flag was added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5256) that can be used to read the password for an existing wallet from a file [(or device or named pipe)](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/wallet.md#auto-unlocking-a-wallet) to auto-unlock it.

### Random Coin Selection

By default `lnd`'s internal wallet uses a coin selection algorithm that always picks the largest UTXOs available first when crafting a transaction. This can lead to a wallet state that has many small and uneconomical UTXOs. To counteract that, a new [`--coin-selection-strategy`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5155) flag was added that can be set to `random` instead of the default `larges` value to enable random coin selection.

## Backend Enhancements &amp; Optimizations

### Daemon-Level Block Cache

[`lnd` now maintains a global daemon-level block cache](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5156) to prevent redundant `GetBlock` calls across all of its sub-systems. This cache can store up to 20MB worth of block data by default, and can be changed through the new config option `blockcachesize`.

### `bitcoind` Pruned Node Support

[`lnd` now supports connecting to pruned `bitcoind` backends](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5154#)! A new sub-system has been introduced that maintains connections to bitcoin peers to retrieve pruned blocks from and caches them. These peers are sourced from the peer list of the connected `bitcoind` instance, or from the `getnodeaddress` RPC otherwise. The number of connections (4 by default) can be configured through the new config option `bitcoind.pruned-node-max-peers`.

### Neutrino Optimizations

The memory footprint used throughout the initial block header sync has been [reduced by 50%](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino/pull/213).

The set of [filter header checkpoints for the mainnet and testnet chains have been updated](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino/pull/215).

### Neutrino Channel Validation

Compact filters retrieved from peers to determine whether the corresponding block contains any relevant transactions are now [validated by checking whether they were constructed correctly](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino/pull/215).

[`lnd` instances _backed by Neutrino_ now have channel validation disabled by default](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5193). Channel validation includes obtaining the block a channel was included in and verifying the channel output remains unspent. This is an intensive process for light-clients as they don't maintain a block index and UTXO set. The `routing.assumechanvalid` config option, which disables channel validation, has now been deprecated. Channel validation can be re-enabled for Neutrino-backed lnd nodes with the new config option `neutrino.validatechannels`.

### Neutrino Configuration

[`neutrino.broadcasttimeout` allows users to specify how long they wish their broadcast attempts to last before giving up](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5257).

[`neutrino.persistfilters` allows users to persist compact filters retrieved from the network](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5257). This will result in less bandwidth consumption at the expense of storage.

[`neutrino.validatechannels` can be activated to enable channel validation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5193). Note that light-clients are not well-equipped to perform this type of validation without SPV channel proofs (keep an eye out for this in future releases!).

### Immediate graph updates for local channels

In [lnd v0.12.0](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.0-beta) we saw a massive enhancement to graph sync, since batch writing of gossip messages to the database was introduced. However, this also included local updates made, which could cause these to become slightly delayed. In this release the local updates will now get special treatment, and [are added immediately](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4964).

### Clustered LND configuration with leader elected primary

So far lnd has mainly been used in single node setups with local databases. This configuration makes it challenging to build a highly available lighting service, since the node itself has to be online and users have to build ad-hoc solutions for database replication and re-deployment in case of failure or datacenter migration.
With the recent addtion of the etcd kvdb driver for lnd we've made incremental steps toward an out-of-the box HA solution.
With this release we [add experimental support for leader elected lnd cluster](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4998), where apart from the graph, all important state can reside in a replicated etcd database. This allows us to use etcd's leader election facilities to form a cluster of multiple lnd nodes, where one of them is the primary node accessing the DB, while the rest are waiting in line to become the leader if a failover happens (eg. primary is decomissioned, crash, network partition, etc). In such configuration all the nodes in the cluster share the same lightning identity but only the active leader has full control while the rest are dormant.

## RPC

### Unification of WalletUnlocker and Lightning services

This release brings a [massive overhaul to the way the wallet is unlocked](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4985) on the backend, while staying backwards compatible.

Earlier version of lnd would bring up a gRPC server that exposed the `WalletUnlocker` service, which would in turn be stopped and restarted to bring up the `Lightning` service after successful unlock. This caused issues with some clients that didn't expect the available services to change during runtime, and it also made it hard to determine the state of the wallet without string matching on the error received from calling the RPC server.

In `lnd v0.13.0`, the two gRPC services (and subserver services) are available at all times such that we avoid tearing down the gRPC server at runtime. The RPC endpoints are gated by the wallet state (see below) such that only RPCs from the `WalletUnlocker` service are available as long as the wallet remains locked.

If you relied on the RPC errors or availability of the different services to determine the wallet state, you should change to use the new `State` service.

### New `State` Service

[A new service](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5005) is now exposed on the `lnd` gRPC server: `State`. This can be used to get the state of the wallet at all times, and should be used to programatically drive the unlocking process.

The possible wallet states are `[NON_EXISTING, LOCKED, UNLOCKED, RPC_ACTIVE]` and the state can be subscribed to using the `SubscribeState` RPC, or fetched using `lncli state`.

### Mission Control

Mission Control's parameters can now [read and set](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4909/) while lnd is running using the `GetMissionControlConfig` and `SetMissionControlConfig` endpoints. This allows nodes to experiment with these parameters without restarting lnd.

An [experimental](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5061) `XImportMissionControl` API has been added to allow nodes to import state from other lnd nodes' `QueryMissionControl` output. This allows new nodes to start include routing insights that another node has learned, rather than starting with no information about the network. This imported information is not currently persisted. Note that sharing your `QueryMissionControl` output with another party may leak information about your payment history.

### Bi-directional Stream Support for REST WebSockets

[A fix to the WebSocket proxy](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5237) now allows all RPCs to be used over REST/WebSockets, including the client-streaming ones (specifically `lnrpc.Lightning.ChannelAcceptor`, `lnrpc.Lightning.SendPayment` and `routerrpc.Router.HtlcInterceptor`).

An [example for using the channel acceptor over REST](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/rest/websockets.md#request-streaming-rpcs) was added to the documentation.

### Option to delete failed payments

In earlier versions of lnd you could delete all finished payments from the database using the `DeleteAllPayments` RPC. Two new flags `failed_payments_only` and `failed_htlcs_only` have been added to this RPC, which can be used to [delete only payments (HTLCs) that failed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/3191).

### `WalletKit` &amp; Wallet-Related RPCs

[`LeaseOutput` has been extended to allow custom lease expirations and a new `ListLeases` RPC has been added to allow users to determine which outputs are currently being leased and for how long](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5095).

As part of our watch-only key import efforts, three new RPCs have been [added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5047/) to the `WalletKit` sub-server to interact with them:

* `ImportAccount` imports an BIP-0049/BIP-0084 account as watch-only through its extended public key (xpub).
* `ImportPublicKey` imports a BIP-0049/BIP-0084 public key into a default &quot;imported&quot; account.
* `ListAccounts` exposes information for accounts (watch-only or not) existing within the wallet.

Several existing RPCs were also [modified](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5047/) (in a backwards-compatible manner) to either accept an account parameter in their requests or break down their responses by accounts.

* `GetTransactions` and `ListUnspent` can now filter through transactions and outputs belonging to a specific account.
* `FundPSBT/FinalizePSBT` can now fund/finalize PSBTs from a specific account.
* `NewAddress` can now generate addresses for a specific account.
* `WalletBalance` now returns an additional breakdown of the total wallet balance by accounts.

### Longer Default Invoice Expiries

Over the past few months, we've heard from multiple sources that the default invoice expiries are too short. As a result, the default expiry for MPP invoices has been [raised from one hour to one day](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/4bb6cc9cee275e7f583039ead826d0fc6f6c4c33/lnrpc/invoicesrpc/addinvoice.go#L29).

### Surfacing `INVALID_ONION_PAYLOAD` failures

Payments that fail with [`INVALID_ONION_PAYLOAD` are now properly reported via SendToRoute and SendPaymentV2](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5074) as `lnrpc.INVALID_ONION_PAYLOAD`. Prior to 0.13 these were reported as `lnrpc.Failure_UNKNOWN_FAILURE`.

## `pprof` Security

lnd will no longer make its pprof port accessible to the world by default, and will [instead listen on localhost if a port is specified](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5063). Exposing the pprof port is still left as an option for certain use cases.

## Mobile

### Simplified API using the State service

Using the mobile bindings one would earlier need to wait for the `unlockerReady` callback to fire to unlock the wallet, and then the second callback`rpcReady` before the lnd RPCs were ready to be used. This was a bit awkward, and not very well supported with React Native.

This release moves back to a single `rpcReady` callback, which together with the new `State` service can be used to determine the state of lnd at all times.

To build lnd with these new bindings for mobile, [falafel v0.9.0](https://github.com/lightninglabs/falafel/releases/tag/v0.9.0) should be used.

### Avoid killing the app on lnd failure

Instead of killing the application in case lnd fails to start, we now [return an error back](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5086) over the API.

### Delayed Zombie Pruning

We [delay graph zombie pruning](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4933) on startup by 30 sec, to avoid blocking on this operation. This shortens the delay from unlocking to lnd is ready, which especially should improve the experience on mobile.

## Bug Fixes

* A regression in the channel state-machine that would lead to de-sync and force close has been [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5231). Channels between upgraded nodes should not experience incorrect force closes.
* The failure message used by the HTLC Interceptor to reject HTLCs has been updated to [include a channel update](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5230) with the temporary channel failure error code.
* A bug that could cause lnd to fail starting up if a new channel was in the process of being opened has [been fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4958).
* In case a channel announcment for a local channel was received after channel closure, `neutrino` backed nodes could end up re-adding the channel to the graph. This has been fixed by [ignoring all local announcements](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4899) coming from our peers.
* A bug in the payment state machine which would result in a payment getting stuck if it received a terminal payment error shortly before dispatching another shard has been [addressed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5214).
* The `SubscribeSingleInvoice` API has been [updated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5207) to terminate the stream of events once the invoice reaches a terminal state.
* During a block storm or integration tests the router subsystem can lag behind on its best known block due to the pruning work it has to complete for each block. Previously the `synced_to_chain` flag of the `GetInfo` RPC would only look at the best height of the wallet vs. its chain backend. To make sure the router is also up to date, [the flag now only turns `true` if the router subsystem is synced to the same height as the wallet](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5281)
* Some terminals don't allow more than 4096 characters to be pasted if running in interactive/TTY mode. This lead to large PSBTs being cut off during channel open. This [was fixed by allowing the PSBT to be read from a file](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5083) in addition to the terminal.
* The `GetNodeInfo` RPC has been [updated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5295) to  output the channel policies for the requested node in the expected order. Previously, its ordering was inconsistent with `DescribeGraph` and `GetChanInfo`.
* The `num_pending_backups` stat exposed by configured watchtower clients through the `WatchtowerClient` sub-server is now properly [decremented after a backup has been accepted](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5212) by a watchtower.

    <summary>## Main changes

### Remove editable fee rate in swap-out

Swap-outs (LN -&gt; on-chain) are actually spending from a shared UTXO set. To make things consistent and ensure good UX for every users, the swap-out fee rate is now defined by the swap service. 

More info here: https://phoenix.acinq.co/faq#why-dont-you-let-me-set-the-feerate-myself-when-sending-on-chain

### Added a button to enlarge the receive QR code

This will help scanning a invoice with low resolution camera.

### Added an option to disable pay-to-open

On-the-fly channel creation has a fee and users may want to disable it. In that case, if a new channel was required to be created in order for a incoming payment to be received, the payment will fail and a notification will be displayed (with a cooldown to prevent notification spam).

    <summary>This release of `btcd` is primarily to act as a catchup for the various changes that have accumulated.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already:

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt` and `manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt.sig` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt.sig
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: assuming signed data in 'manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt'
gpg: Signature made Tue 08 Jun 2021 10:07:53 AM EDT
gpg:                using DSA key 0DB39EAF526568682088EEDFB15210D35378BD54
gpg: Good signature from &quot;John C. Vernaleo &lt;john@netpurgatory.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]

```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Binaries

As of this release, our release binaries are **fully reproducible** thanks to `go1.13`! Third parties are now able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/tree/master/release) for how this can be achieved. The release binaries are compiled with `go1.16.5`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:
```
git verify-tag v0.22.0-beta
```

You should see something along the lines of this in the case of a valid tag:
```
gpg: Signature made Tue 08 Jun 2021 09:42:52 AM EDT
gpg:                using DSA key 0DB39EAF526568682088EEDFB15210D35378BD54
gpg: Good signature from &quot;John C. Vernaleo &lt;john@netpurgatory.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

# Building the Contained Release

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming that `vendor.tar.gz` and `btcd-source-v0.22.0-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf btcd-source-v0.22.0.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor ./cmd/btcctl
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory.

Additionally, it's also possible to use the enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so:

```
BTCBUILDSYS=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot; ./build/release/release.sh
```

    <link href="https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/releases/tag/v0.22.0-beta"/>
    <summary>This release of `btcd` is primarily to act as a catchup for the various changes that have accumulated.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already:

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt` and `manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt.sig` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt.sig
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: assuming signed data in 'manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt'
gpg: Signature made Tue 08 Jun 2021 10:07:53 AM EDT
gpg:                using DSA key 0DB39EAF526568682088EEDFB15210D35378BD54
gpg: Good signature from &quot;John C. Vernaleo &lt;john@netpurgatory.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]

```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Binaries

As of this release, our release binaries are **fully reproducible** thanks to `go1.13`! Third parties are now able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/tree/master/release) for how this can be achieved. The release binaries are compiled with `go1.16.5`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:
```
git verify-tag v0.22.0-beta
```

You should see something along the lines of this in the case of a valid tag:
```
gpg: Signature made Tue 08 Jun 2021 09:42:52 AM EDT
gpg:                using DSA key 0DB39EAF526568682088EEDFB15210D35378BD54
gpg: Good signature from &quot;John C. Vernaleo &lt;john@netpurgatory.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

# Building the Contained Release

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming that `vendor.tar.gz` and `btcd-source-v0.22.0-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf btcd-source-v0.22.0.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor ./cmd/btcctl
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory.

Additionally, it's also possible to use the enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so:

```
BTCBUILDSYS=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot; ./build/release/release.sh
```

### Assets
No new assets.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.6.5.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.6.5-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.6.5.jar.txt file.

*NEW: There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.6.5.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 11.0.10 and the v1.6.5 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.*

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.6.5.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <summary>## Main changes

### Add support for LNURL-pay

[LNURL-pay](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/master/lnurl-pay.md) is an offband protocol using http requests to get invoices from a compliant node. It supports comments, min/max amounts, metadata (including images) and callback messages from the recipient (including encrypted messages that can only be read once the payment is successful, using the preimage).

This change does not mean that Phoenix offers static invoices, but that it can now pay them.

    <link href="https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/releases/tag/v0.6.0"/>
    <summary>This release makes some core features mandatory, includes a few important bug fixes and several performance improvements.
It is fully compatible with 0.5.1 (and all previous versions of eclair).

# Major changes

### Mandatory payment secrets

This release makes two important features mandatory:

- `var_onion_optin` (added to the spec in [July 2019](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/619))
- `payment_secret` (added to the spec in [December 2019](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/643))

These features have been widely deployed and protect against privacy attacks and stealing payments to 0-value invoices (as described [here](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/671)).
You won't be able to connect to nodes that don't support these features nor pay invoices that don't include a `payment_secret`.

### Improved detection of stale blocks

Eclair uses [ZMQ](https://zeromq.org/) to receive blocks and transactions from your bitcoin node.
While ZMQ is usually very reliable, we discovered that its pub/sub model has some limitations.
If a subscriber encounters network failures, it will silently disconnect without notifying the publisher.
This never happens when your bitcoin node is on the same machine as eclair, but may happen when bitcoin is running on a remote machine and a VPN is used between the two machines.
Eclair now sets a TCP keep-alive on the ZMQ socket to work around this limitation and quickly reconnect.

The blockchain watchdogs have also been improved to run at fixed intervals if no blocks are received.
They will poll secondary blockchain sources (bitcoinheaders.net, blockstream.info, mempool.space and blockcypher.com) to detect that your eclair node is missing blocks.

### Electrum support removed

This release removes support for using Electrum instead of Bitcoin Core for your bitcoin wallet.
Electrum support was necessary for mobile wallets, but wasn't recommended for server deployments.
Wallets are migrating to our [Kotlin lightning stack](https://github.com/acinq/lightning-kmp), so eclair can now target exclusively server deployments.

Eclair depends on many low-level `bitcoind` RPCs for fee bumping which aren't available yet in Electrum.

### Improved Postgres support

We previously introduced beta support for using [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/blob/master/docs/PostgreSQL.md) as database backend in eclair v0.4.1.
We've fixed some bugs since then and improved the integration, but please note that PostgreSQL support is still in beta.
We're actively working on finalizing this integration and making PostgreSQL production-ready in a future release.

### Support for future segwit versions

This release adds support for `option_shutdown_anysegwit` (spec PR available [here](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/672)).
Current segwit bitcoin addresses (P2WPKH and P2WSH) only use segwit version 0, but this change lets nodes use bitcoin addresses with other version numbers (taproot will use version 1).

### API changes

This release updates a few APIs:

- Features are now displayed as a map (feature name -&gt; support) in API responses (#1715)
- Channel internal state tracking force-close scenarios has been enriched (#1728)
- A `--blocking=&lt;bool&gt;` option has been added to the `payinvoice` API (#1751)

We've also updated our internal API DSL, which paves the way for more plugin integration in a future release.
Head over to our [API documentation](https://acinq.github.io/eclair) for more details.

### Miscellaneous improvements and bug fixes

- Eclair now defaults to Bech32 addresses (#1717)
- Anchor output commitment feerate is now configurable (#1718)
- All outputs of revoked anchor output commitments are claimed (there is a subtle edge case, see #1738)
- Internal codec packages and database versions have been reworked to improve future backwards-compatibility
- Several improvements have been made to our path-finding algorithms, improving tail latency
- A bug affecting reconnections to peers has been fixed (#1760)
- A bug affecting transaction outputs ordering (which can lead to channel force-close) has been fixed (#1806)

# Verifying signatures

You will need `gpg` and our release signing key 7A73FE77DE2C4027. Note that you can get it:

- from our website: https://acinq.co/pgp/drouinf.asc
- from github user @sstone, a committer on eclair: https://api.github.com/users/sstone/gpg_keys

To import our signing key:

```sh
$ gpg --import drouinf.asc
```

To verify the release file checksums and signatures:

```sh
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped
```

# Building

Eclair builds are deterministic. To reproduce our builds, please use the following environment (*):

- Ubuntu 20.04
- AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.6
- Maven 3.8.1

Use the following command to generate the eclair-node package:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

That should generate `eclair-node/target/eclair-node-0.6.0-XXXXXXX-bin.zip` with sha256 checksums that match the one we provide and sign in `SHA256SUMS.asc`

(*) You may be able to build the exact same artefacts with other operating systems or versions of JDK 11, we have not tried everything.

# Upgrading

This release is fully compatible with eclair v0.5.1. You don't need to close your channels, just stop eclair, upgrade and restart.

### Assets
No new assets.

## Verification

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.6.4.dmg)

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.6.4.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <summary># v0.6.0 - Javascript!

## Executive Summary

This release support [scalajs](https://www.scala-js.org/) for both the `crypto` and `core` module. You can now use these modules from javascript.

We now support docker for our oracleServer and appServer projects.
Follow these links for docker builds for [`appServer`](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/applications/server#docker-configuration) and [`oracleServer`](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/oracle/build-oracle-server#docker-configuration)

We support the latest bitcoind rpc client (`0.21.1`) that has the taproot activation code baked into it.

Our libsecp256k1 pre-compiled binaries now support `osx_arm64` which makes them compatible with the new M1 chip from Apple.

Finally, we had to re-write the git history for this release due to #2830 . This means previous commits have been re-written.

## Running Bitcoin-S

If you want to run the standalone server binary, after verifying gpg signatures, you
can `unzip bitcoin-s-server-0.6.0.zip` and then run it with `./bin/bitcoin-s-server` to start the node. You will need to
configure the node properly first, you can find example
configurations [here](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/config/configuration#example-configuration-file).

You can then unzip the `bitcoin-s-cli-0.6.0.zip` folder and start using the `bitcoin-s-cli` like this:

```bashrc
./bin/bitcoin-s-cli --help
Usage: bitcoin-s-cli [options] [&lt;cmd&gt;]

  -n, --network &lt;value&gt;    Select the active network.
  --debug                  Print debugging information
  --rpcport &lt;value&gt;        The port to send our rpc request to on the server
  -h, --help               Display this help message and exit
```

For more information on what commands `bitcoin-s-cli` supports check the documentation, here is where to
start: https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/applications/server#server-endpoints

## Verifying signatures

This release is signed with [Chris's signing key](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/security#disclosure) with
fingerprint `339A49229576050819083EB3F99724872F822910`

To do the verification, first hash the executable using `sha256sum`. You should check that the result is listed in
the `SHA256SUMS.asc` file next to its file name. After doing that you can use `gpg --verify` to authenticate the
signature.

Example:

```
$ sha256sum bitcoin-s-server-0.6.0.zip
48585b6cb0e4ec29773bde619486cadd5fef6c0d480df54520bb52bea2f678b6  bitcoin-s-server-0.6.0.zip
$  gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
gpg: Signature made Thu 04 Feb 2021 12:49:59 PM CST
gpg:                using RSA key 339A49229576050819083EB3F99724872F822910
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Chris Stewart &lt;stewart.chris1234@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 339A 4922 9576 0508 1908  3EB3 F997 2487 2F82 2910
```

Or you can verify all binaries at once with the following commands:

```
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped

### New modules

We added a few new modules in the 0.6. We will provide brief descriptions for
the new modules below.

#### CoreJS &amp; CryptoJS

This are scalajs compatible modules for our `crypto` and `core` projects.
This means that you can now use the `crypto` and `core` modules in both
the browser and nodejs runtimes.

#### TestkitCore

We split `testkit` into two modules this release. Now `testkitcore` is scalajs
compatible, while `testkit` still takes in heavier weight JVM dependencies. `testkitcore` is
used to test the scalajs projects like `cryptoJS` and `coreJS`.

c6c4e83e9eb Remove logging from testkit core (#2813)

1959495cec2 Add testkit-core module (#2726)

#### Lnd rpc client

This is a new lnd rpc client for the bitcoin-s project. You can now interact with a lnd daemon
using bitcoin-s.

Not all lnd rpc functions are implemented as of this release.

8ec93c66322 Add protoc exception for apples new chip arch. This requires protoc to be built manually as they do not natively ship m1 support yet (#3013)

4055de7690f Inital LND rpc with some tests (#2836)

#### AsyncUtil

This is basic async functionality that is compatible with scalajs. This is used by `testkitcore`
to test async code.

65cb0d16155 Move tests out of bitcoindRpcTest that belong in async-utils (#2796)

7a068ac036b 2021 02 25 async utils (#2725)

#### Suredbits Oracle Explorer Client

This is an implementation of our API for the oracle server. You can now use this to
post announcements, and attestations to the oracle explorer. For more information
on the API please see the [docs](https://gist.github.com/Christewart/a9e55d9ba582ac9a5ceffa96db9d7e1f).

49b6d39ab46 Implement Oracle Explorer Client (#2838)

#### Scripts

This is a new module that provides useful scripts to run with bitcoin-s. We have two as of the
time of this writing

1. `ScanBitcoind` - scans against bitcoind with a height range. You need bitcoind connection configured in your `bitcoin-s.conf`
2. `ZipDatadir` - compresses the bitcoin-s datadir into a `.zip` file

136d6f50f9c 2021 04 19 Zip Bitcoin-s datadir (#2927)

### Existing modules 

#### App server

The primary changes in `appServer` are  api bug fixes, adding new endpoints (`estimateee`)
and using akka streams to improve efficiency when processing blocks from bitcoind.

b1be3347c99 Fix ZMQ Config with bitcoind backend (#2897)

#### Crypto

The primary changes in the crypto module are adding support for [ecdsa adaptor signatures](https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/pull/114)
which are a fundamental primitive discreet log contracts. 

The other major change in the crypto module is adding support for scalajs. To implement
this we decided to use [`bcrypto`](https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcrypto/) as the javascript implementation of crypto.

To do this, we now have a `CryptoRuntime` trait that gives an interface to be implemented against
for generic crypto runtimes support in bitcoin-s.

7764828b3a7 Bump timeout on bind to avoid spurious ci failures hopefully (#2791)

#### Wallet

This wallet release moves all OS resources such as threads into `WalleAppConfig`. 
Now you need to call `WalletAppConfig.stop()` to free those resources.
Now you can treat the `Wallet` data structure as any old Scala/Java object rather
than having to worry about leaking resources.

There are also a variety of bug fixes and performance improvements in this release.

27afb662206 2021 04 23 issue Move rebroadcast scheduling into WalletAppConfig (#2957)

1339abe410e 2021 05 02 m1 secp256k1 natives (#3014)

#### Testkit

This release for testkit focuses on fixing resource leaks in the fixture code.
There were multiple places we were not shutting down threads and connection pools
through out the testkit project. 

This project also introduces the `CachedBitcoind` abstraction. Previously we would
spin up a new bitcoind for EVERY test that is ran. This is obviously inefficient.

Now we cache a bitcoind and re-use it for the entire test suite.
This improves CI reliability greatly, and reduces required resources to run our test suites.

a2911f31edf Fix race condition with BitcoindChainHandlerViaZmqTest (#2990)

#### DLC oracle

This release makes the oracle have its own directory `$HOME/.bitcoin-s/oracle`

We also now provide the ability to delete and oracle's signatures.
This is useful for when you accidentally submit signatures for an attestment, but don't publish it anywhere.

the `oracleServer` configuration from the `appServer` configuration.

There is also simplifications and bug fixes included in this release for the oracle server.

    <link href="https://github.com/ACINQ/phoenix/releases/tag/v1.4.10"/>
    <summary>## Main changes

### Reject invoices that have already been paid

The app now checks if an invoice has already been paid before sending. This does not work if the app has been restored and the payment is not in the database anymore.

### Add information notice when the pay-to-open and swap-in features are disabled

Channel creation features involve on-chain operations and may be disabled when the mempool is congested. The app now degrades gracefully and properly informs the user, and also prevents using the swap-in feature.

Note that in that case the user is still able to receive using existing channels.

    <link href="https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.6.2"/>
    <summary>**A newer version is already available! Please don’t use this version anymore.**

This is a hotfix release that [fixes an issue with SPV resync introduced in v1.6.0](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5380) and fixes a [minor bug in the portfolio view](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5385) when price nodes aren't available.

For more details please see https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/milestone/56?closed=1

Here are the release notes from v1.6.0:

## Release notes
This release ships the official beta release for the Bisq API! It has been tested on mainnet, but is still in beta, so please be careful.

Other highlights: absolute minimum deposits have now been lowered from 0.006 BTC to 0.001 BTC. Maker and taker fee transactions are now verified via mempool.space to reduce trade issues, and mediation and arbitration were improved as well. And as always, there are many bug fixes and refinements.

Also important: this release ships part of 1 of 2 for BSQ SegWit implementation. It prepares the network for handling SegWit BSQ transactions (activation block is 680300, around 2021/04/25 -- all full nodes should update to 1.6.0+ before that time). Shortly after this activation point, the wallet code (https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5109) will be merged into master for testing so that the full BSQ SegWit update is shipped in the following release.

### Assets
No new assets.

## Verification

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.6.2.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
`shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/Java/Bisq-1.6.2.jar`
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.6.2.jar.txt file.


## Known issues with installation 

### macOS Catalina:

&gt; Bisq can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

This happens the first time Bisq is run on macOS Catalina. It is because a new security feature in Catalina has newer requirements of how apps are packaged. We are working on ways to address this (see #3402 and #4196 for details).

Workaround: Right click on the installed Bisq app &gt; Click `Open` (warning popup shown again, but with new button available) &gt; Click `Open`

&gt; Bisq would like to receive keystrokes from any application.

Discussed in issue https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373, you will see a permission request in the latest macOS version that Bisq wants to receive keystrokes from any application. Unfortunately that is an issue for all Java applications that are run on Catalina right now. We are investigating already how to solve this issue and will fix in one of our next updates.

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/Bisq/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.6.2.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/releases/tag/v0.10.0"/>
    <summary>We're pleased to announce the 0.10.0 release of c-lightning, named by  @jsarenik.

This is a major release, consolidating a number of features, fixes and experimental extensions.

## Highlights for Users
- `pay` has been refined and much improved across various less-common scenarios.
- `listpeers` shows the current feerate and unilateral close fee.
- `listforwards` can now filter by channel status, and in or out channel.
- `fundpsbt` and `utxopsbt` have a new `excess_as_change` parameter if you don't want to add it yourself.
- `connect` returns the address we actually connected to (and `direction` tells you if they actually connected to us instead).
- `fundchannel_complete` takes a PSBT, removing a common cause of tragic opening failures: `txprepare` and `withdraw` now provide a PSBT for convenience too.
- In regtest mode, we don't care that bitcoind doesn't give any fee estimates, but use the minimum.

## Highlights for the Network
- We now send `warning` messages if an error condition is possibly recoverable, rather than closing the channel and sending `error`.
- We now implement `sync_complete` for gossip_range queries as per latest spec, with backwards compatibility for older nodes.
- `experimental-dual-fund` config option enables the draft dual funding option for compatible nodes, which includes RBF upgrades for opening transactions.

## Highlights for Developers
- All hooks are now registerable by multiple plugins at once.
- `experimental-shutdown-wrong-funding` allows remote nodes to close incorrectly opened channels using the new `wrong_funding` option to `close`.

More details can be found in the [changelog](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/v0.10.0/CHANGELOG.md).

Thanks to everyone for their contributions and bug reports; please keep them coming.

Since 0.9.3, we've had 339 commits from 14 different authors over 69 days.

A special thanks goes to the 3 first time contributors:

- Matthias Debernardini
- Luke Childs
- Alexey Zagarin

Cheers,
Rusty, Lisa, Christian,  ZmnSCPxj

    <link href="https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.6.1"/>
    <summary>**A newer version is already available! Please don’t use this version anymore.**

This is a follow-up release that [allows default fee values in leniency checks](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5365), [fixes an issue in the the new portfolio history popup](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5363) and upgrades to the [latest Tor version v0.4.5.7](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5364) that fixes two important denial-of-service bugs in earlier versions of Tor.

For more details please see https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/milestone/54?closed=1

Here are the release notes from v1.6.0:

## Release notes
This release ships the official beta release for the Bisq API! It has been tested on mainnet, but is still in beta, so please be careful.

Other highlights: absolute minimum deposits have now been lowered from 0.006 BTC to 0.001 BTC. Maker and taker fee transactions are now verified via mempool.space to reduce trade issues, and mediation and arbitration were improved as well. And as always, there are many bug fixes and refinements.

Also important: this release ships part of 1 of 2 for BSQ SegWit implementation. It prepares the network for handling SegWit BSQ transactions (activation block is 680300, around 2021/04/25 -- all full nodes should update to 1.6.0+ before that time). Shortly after this activation point, the wallet code (https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5109) will be merged into master for testing so that the full BSQ SegWit update is shipped in the following release.

### Assets
No new assets.

## Verification

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.6.1.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
`shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/Java/Bisq-1.6.1.jar`
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.6.1.jar.txt file.


## Known issues with installation 

### macOS Catalina:

&gt; Bisq can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

This happens the first time Bisq is run on macOS Catalina. It is because a new security feature in Catalina has newer requirements of how apps are packaged. We are working on ways to address this (see #3402 and #4196 for details).

Workaround: Right click on the installed Bisq app &gt; Click `Open` (warning popup shown again, but with new button available) &gt; Click `Open`

&gt; Bisq would like to receive keystrokes from any application.

Discussed in issue https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373, you will see a permission request in the latest macOS version that Bisq wants to receive keystrokes from any application. Unfortunately that is an issue for all Java applications that are run on Catalina right now. We are investigating already how to solve this issue and will fix in one of our next updates.

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/Bisq/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.6.1.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

The last hotfix release broke the Tor installation on fresh installs. This release fixes this.

- **Fix Tor installation on fresh installs** 

# Newbie Guide

While setting up Wasabi is straightforward, even a Linux wizard with the longest beard can get stuck on the most basic tasks. Consider taking a look at the [Installation Instructions](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/InstallPackage.html) guide.

# Advanced Guide

If you want to build Wasabi from source code or update the source code check out [these instructions.](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/BuildSource.html)

From version 1.1.3 Wasabi also introduces [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/): [Deterministic Build Guide](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/Guides/DeterministicBuildGuide.md)

Build with .NET Core 3.1.407-win-x64.

    <link href="https://github.com/bwt-dev/bwt/releases/tag/v0.2.3"/>
    <summary>### Changelog

- New `--prune-until &lt;target&gt;` option to automatically prune the chain up to the given target (height, unix timestamp or YYYY-MM-DD formatted date)

  Require configuring bitcoind with `prune=1` to allow manual pruning via the RPC.

- New `--no-wait-sync` option to allow importing addresses without waiting for bitcoind to finish syncing first

  Useful for tracking wallets during the IBD of a pruned node, so transactions could be indexed before the blocks get pruned.

- Fix compatibility with the upcoming v0.22 Bitcoin Core release (https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/issues/67#issuecomment-791522237)

- HTTP: Set the `WWW-Authenticate` header to make logging-in possible via web browsers

- Implement an [fd-based daemon readiness notification mechanism](https://skarnet.org/software/s6/notifywhenup.html), enabled with `FD_NOTIFY=&lt;fd&gt;`

- Fix whitepaper extractor

- UX touchups for progress indicator, welcome banner and logs

- Allow setting `UNIX_LISTENER_MODE` to control permissions for the unix socket notification listener

- Allow setting `NO_REQUIRE_ADDRESSES` as an env variable

Breaking CLI changes:

- The Electrum SOCKS5-based authentication needs to be explicitly enabled with `--electrum-socks-auth`,
  in addition to enabling the `--auth-*` options. By default, authentication will only be enabled for
  the HTTP API server.

    <summary># Summary

The recent macOS update broke the initialization of the build-in Tor client in Wasabi. As a result, the client was not able to start Tor client, thus it was not able to connect to our Backend. 

- **Tor fix on the newest macOS.** 
- **Update HWI to 2.0.0**
- **Add Ledger Nano X support**

    <summary>Also available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/hwi/) and can be installed with `pip install -U hwi`

## Added
* BitBox02 multisig signing.
* Documentation automatically generated with sphinx and hosted on https://hwi.readthedocs.io.
* Support for Python 3.9.
* Trezor allows transactions with OP_RETURN outputs.
* Full type annotations within `hwilib` and type checking.
* Updated documentation for Bitcoin Core descriptor wallets.
* Device support policy
* Enforce that the Ledger is in either the Bitcoin or Bitcoin Testnet apps.

## Changed
* `--sh_wpkh` and `--wpkh` options have been replaced with `--addr-type` with the options `legacy`, `sh_wit`, and `wit`.
* `--testnet` option replaced with `--chain` with the options `main`, `test`, `signet`, and `regtest`.
* Overhauled descriptors implementation to be similar to Bitcoin Core's descriptors implementation.
* Replaced `HardwareWalletClient.display_address` with `display_singlesig_address` and `display_multisig_address`.
* Overhauled `HardwareWalletClient` functions to return the correct objects rather than string dictionaries.
* Raise errors and exceptions instead of returning string dictionary containing error.
* `bech32.py`, `base58.py`, `cli.py`, and `gui.py` are made internal modules.
* `serializations.py` is split into `tx.py`, `psbt.py` with some functions made internal with `_script.py` and `_serialize.py`.
* `getmasterxpub` takes options for chain type, address type, and BIP 44 account in order to provide the master xpub accordingly.

## Removed
* Removed option to provide redeem script to `displayaddress`.

## Fixed
* Fixed Ledger change path detection.
* Fixed Ledger message signing when the signature is shorter than expected.
* Fixed Trezor One pin sending when a passphrase is expected.
* Fixed handling of `sortedmulti()` descriptors. Some devices which only supported key sorting will be no longer allow `multi()` descriptors. The multisigs that devices use when given a `sortedmulti()` descriptor will now match what Bitcoin Core derives for those descriptors.
* Several fixes to device enumeration.
* `installudevrules` will search for the correct binaries in the PATH rather than assuming their locations.</summary>

    <summary>## Main changes

The channel creation fee for pay-to-open has been increased: it's still 0.1% but there is now a 1000 sat minimum. The manual confirmation dialog and asynchronous pay-to-open logic have been removed. The FTUE page regarding the channel opening cost has been updated as well as the swap-in dialog so that we can display this new fee minimum value.

## Complete list of changes

- **app**: https://github.com/ACINQ/phoenix/compare/v1.4.7...v1.4.8

## Verifying signatures

You will need `gpg` and our release signing key E434ED292E85643A. Note that you can get it:
- from our website: https://acinq.co/pgp/padioupm.asc
- from github user @pm47, a committer on eclair: https://api.github.com/users/pm47/gpg_keys

To import our signing key:
```
$ gpg --import padioupm.asc
```

To verify the release file checksums and signatures:
```
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped

    <summary>## Main changes

### Improve LNURL error feedback

Errors returned by LNURL services were not properly handled and information was lost, causing confusion, especially for LNURL-withdraw.

### Notify user when channel opening is rejected

If a new channel must be created to receive an incoming payment but the amount is below the channel creation threshold, a notification is displayed. Note that this is not enabled yet because changes on the peer side are also needed.

-- edit: this is now enabled.

### Assets
No new assets.

## Verification

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.5.9.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
`shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/Java/Bisq-1.5.9.jar`
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.5.9.jar.txt file.


## Known issues with installation 

### macOS Catalina:

&gt; Bisq can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

This happens the first time Bisq is run on macOS Catalina. It is because a new security feature in Catalina has newer requirements of how apps are packaged. We are working on ways to address this (see #3402 and #4196 for details).

Workaround: Right click on the installed Bisq app &gt; Click `Open` (warning popup shown again, but with new button available) &gt; Click `Open`

&gt; Bisq would like to receive keystrokes from any application.

Discussed in issue https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373, you will see a permission request in the latest macOS version that Bisq wants to receive keystrokes from any application. Unfortunately that is an issue for all Java applications that are run on Catalina right now. We are investigating already how to solve this issue and will fix in one of our next updates.

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/Bisq/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.5.9.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/releases/tag/v0.5.1"/>
    <summary>This release includes many bug fixes and improvements, a new API and monitoring updates.
It is fully compatible with 0.5.0 (and all previous versions of eclair).

# Major changes

### Improved startup performance

When eclair starts up and restores channels, it makes a lot of calls to `bitcoind` to check the status of each channel.
We improved our calling pattern to greatly reduce the number of calls made when some channels are closing.
This is particularly noticeable when the mempool is quite full and you have many channels.

See #1699 for details.

### Gossip sync improvements

Most of the bandwidth consumed by lightning nodes is due to gossip (syncing the network graph).
When your eclair node has a lot of peers and doesn't use a `sync-whitelist`, you may end up syncing with many different peers and obtaining redundant information, thus wasting bandwidth.
Eclair now only syncs with peers you have a channel with to reduce bandwidth usage.

### Anchor outputs

This release contains a lot of changes for the upcoming anchor outputs commitment format:

- the feerate of the commitment transaction is kept low to improve off-chain channel usage
- transactions with multiple inputs and outputs are now supported
- CPFP and RBF utilities have been added to increase the feerate of commitment and htlc transactions

While you can start experimenting with this commitment format, it is still not safe to activate in production.
Anchor outputs is a complex and subtle change that requires re-architecting most of our transaction broadcasting logic and utxo management.
We are making steady progress towards that, but we're not there yet.

### Monitoring changes

Kamon tracing has been removed in this release.
It was too invasive in the codebase, generally unused and was costing some bandwidth.
We've found that metrics and logs are enough to correctly monitor your eclair node.

Additional metrics to monitor transaction signing have been added.
The rate of transaction signatures is a good indicator of how busy your node is.

### API changes

This release adds a new path-finding API:

- `findroutebetweennodes` lets you inspect the network graph by looking for routes between two nodes (whereas `findroute` only allowed finding routes between your node and a remote node)

Head over to our [API documentation](https://acinq.github.io/eclair) for more details.

### Miscellaneous improvements and bug fixes

- Correctly sort addresses in its `node_announcement` (#1693)
- Allow 2016 blocks before unconfirmed channels are forgotten (#1692)
- Re-emit private channel updates more frequently, improving payments to mobile wallets (#1671)
- Correctly handle channel failures in private routing hints, fixing an edge case for payments to mobile wallets (#1675)
- Drop support for `initial_routing_sync`: this was bandwidth-heavy and now unnecessary (#1683)
- Fix an MPP-send edge-case (#1685)
- Fix race condition between outgoing payment and peer disconnection (#1688)
- Fix race condition between `update_fee` and `shutdown`, which could lead to channels stuck in `shutdown` (#1661)
- Ensure transactions we publish always meet bitcoin's `min_relay_fee` (#1687)
- Fix an edge case where an HTLC failure was not correctly relayed upstream if `revoke_and_ack` had not been received (#1706)

# Verifying signatures

You will need `gpg` and our release signing key 7A73FE77DE2C4027. Note that you can get it:

- from our website: https://acinq.co/pgp/drouinf.asc
- from github user @sstone, a committer on eclair: https://api.github.com/users/sstone/gpg_keys

To import our signing key:

```sh
$ gpg --import drouinf.asc
```

To verify the release file checksums and signatures:

```sh
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped
```

# Building

Eclair builds are deterministic. To reproduce our builds, please use the following environment (*):

- Ubuntu 19.10
- AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.6
- Maven 3.6.3

Use the following command to generate the eclair-node package:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

That should generate `eclair-node/target/eclair-node-0.5.1-XXXXXXX-bin.zip` with sha256 checksums that match the one we provide and sign in `SHA256SUMS.asc`

(*) You may be able to build the exact same artefacts with other operating systems or versions of JDK 11, we have not tried everything.

# Upgrading

This release is fully compatible with Eclair v0.5.0. You don't need to close your channels, just stop eclair, upgrade and restart.
