    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.13.4-beta"/>
    <summary>This is a small patch release [that fixes a Taproot related bug for Neutrino](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino/pull/234). If you run neutrino in production, we _strongly_ recommend you update to this version before Taproot activation to ensure your node keeps moving forward in the chain. 

This release only contains a single commit on top of the prior 0.13.3 minor release: https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/compare/0-13-3-branch...0-13-4-branch?expand=1

# Database Migrations

This release does not contain any database migrations.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.4-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.13.4-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.4-beta.sig manifest-v0.13.4-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Wed Sep 30 17:35:20 2020 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 4AB7F8DA6FAEBB3B70B1F903BC13F65E2DC84465
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.4-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.4-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.4-beta.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.16.3`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, `watchtowerrpc` and `monitoring`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.13.4-beta
gpg: Signature made Tue Sep 15 18:55:00 2020 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 4AB7F8DA6FAEBB3B70B1F903BC13F65E2DC84465
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.13.4-beta /verify-install.sh v0.13.4-beta
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.13.4-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.13.4-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.4-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.4-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

# Release Notes

    <link href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/releases/tag/v0.10.2"/>
    <summary>We're pleased to announce the 0.10.2 release of c-lightning, named by @vincenzopalazzo.

This is a recommended upgrade: this release includes the patch for the recently disclosed [CVE-2021-41592][cve].

[cve]: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41592

## Highlights for Users

 - Payments can now be retried without affecting the status of prior attempts.
 - The route selection will now use the log-propability-based channel selection to increase success rate and reduce time to completion.
 - `close` now reports the feeranges each side enforced, which allows users to determine which side caused a high or low feerate.
 - Removal of old HTLC information and vacuuming shrinks large lightningd.sqlite3 by a factor of 2-3.

# Highlights for the Network

 - `setchannelfee` now has a grace period during which both old and new fee policies are considered. This prevents a fee update from making the channel unusable until the update propagated.
 - We now perform quick-close if the peer supports it.
 - We send regular pings to detect dead connections (particularly for Tor).
 - Errors returning a channel_update no longer return an outdated one.
 - Anchor output mutual close allow a fee higher than the final commitment transaction
 
# Highlights for Developers

 - Plugins now are notified about an upcoming shutdown, allowing them to store data and clean up before exiting.
 - The datastore API (`datastore`, `deldatastore`, and `listdatastore`) exposes a simple key-value store, allowing plugin authors to store data in the c-lightning database.
 - `ping` now only works if we have a channel with the peer.
 - Relaxed the sqlite3 version match requirements to be at least a minimum version and a major version match

More details can be found in the changelog.

Thanks to everyone for their contributions and bug reports; please keep them coming.

Since 0.10.1, we've had 333 commits from 19 different authors over 85 days.

A special thanks goes to the 4 first time contributors:

 - Dustin Dettmer
 - Michael Folkson
 - jerzybrzoska
 - Devrandom

    <link href="https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning/releases/tag/v0.0.103"/>
    <summary>## API Updates
 * This release is almost entirely focused on a new API in the
   `lightning-invoice` crate - the `InvoicePayer`. `InvoicePayer` is a
   struct which takes a reference to a `ChannelManager` and a `Router`
   and retries payments as paths fail. It limits retries to a configurable
   number, but is not serialized to disk and may retry additional times across
   a serialization/load. In order to learn about failed payments, it must
   receive `Event`s directly from the `ChannelManager`, wrapping a
   user-provided `EventHandler` which it provides all unhandled events to
   (#1059).
 * `get_route` has been renamed `find_route` (#1059) and now takes a
   `RouteParameters` struct in replacement of a number of its long list of
   arguments (#1134). The `Payee` in the `RouteParameters` is stored in the
   `Route` object returned and provided in the `RouteParameters` contained in
   `Event::PaymentPathFailed` (#1059).
 * `ChannelMonitor`s must now be persisted after calls that provide new block
   data, prior to `MonitorEvent`s being passed back to `ChannelManager` for
   processing. If you are using a `ChainMonitor` this is handled for you.
   The `Persist` API has been updated to `Option`ally take the
   `ChannelMonitorUpdate` as persistence events that result from chain data no
   longer have a corresponding update (#1108).
 * `routing::Score` now has a `payment_path_failed` method which it can use to
   learn which channels often fail payments. It is automatically called by
   `InvoicePayer` for failed payment paths (#1144).
 * The default `Scorer` implementation is now a type alias to a type generic
   across different clocks and supports serialization to persist scoring data
   across restarts (#1146).
 * `Event::PaymentSent` now includes the full fee which was spent across all
   payment paths which were fulfilled or pending when the payment was fulfilled
   (#1142).
 * `Event::PaymentSent` and `Event::PaymentPathFailed` now include the
   `PaymentId` which matches the `PaymentId` returned from
   `ChannelManager::send_payment` or `InvoicePayer::pay_invoice` (#1059).
 * `NetGraphMsgHandler` now takes a `Deref` to the `NetworkGraph`, allowing for
   shared references to the graph data to make serialization and references to
   the graph data in the `InvoicePayer`'s `Router` simpler (#1149).
 * `routing::Score::channel_penalty_msat` has been updated to provide the
   `NodeId` of both the source and destination nodes of a channel (#1133).

## Bug Fixes
 * Previous versions would often disconnect peers during initial graph sync due
   to ping timeouts while processing large numbers of gossip messages. We now
   delay disconnecting peers if we receive messages from them even if it takes
   a while to receive a pong from them. Further, we avoid sending too many
   gossip messages between pings to ensure we should always receive pongs in a
   timely manner (#1137).
 * If a payment was sent, creating an outbound HTLC and sending it to our
   counterparty (implying the `ChannelMonitor` was persisted on disk), but the
   `ChannelManager` was not persisted prior to shutdown/crash, no
   `Event::PaymentPathFailed` event was generated if the HTLC was eventually
   failed on chain. Events are now consistent irrespective of `ChannelManager`
   persistence or non-persistence (#1104).

## Serialization Compatibility
 * All above new Events/fields are ignored by prior clients. All above new
   Events/fields are not present when reading objects serialized by prior
   versions of the library.
 * Payments for which a `Route` was generated using a previous version or for
   which the payment was originally sent by a previous version of the library
   will not be retried by an `InvoicePayer`.

This release was singularly focused and some contributions by third parties
were delayed.

    <summary># Summary

This release contains an important stability upgrade on Tor. Some of our users encountered network instability like delays on Tor so it is recommended to upgrade your client to this version. In addition, there were some minor bug fixes as well. Make sure your Tor client is not running in the background so Wasabi can update it - the easiest way is to restart your machine and start the new version of Wasabi. 

- Updated Tor client to [0.4.5.10](https://blog.torproject.org/node/2062).

# Newbie Guide

While setting up Wasabi is straightforward, even a Linux wizard with the longest beard can get stuck on the most basic tasks. Consider taking a look at the [Installation Instructions](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/InstallPackage.html) guide.

# Advanced Guide

If you want to build Wasabi from source code or update the source code check out [these instructions.](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/BuildSource.html)

From version 1.1.3 Wasabi also introduces [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/): [Deterministic Build Guide](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/Guides/DeterministicBuildGuide.md)

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.7.4.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.7.4-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.7.4.jar.txt file.

There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.7.4.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 11.0.10 and the v1.7.4 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.7.4.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <summary>## API Updates
 * `get_route` now takes a `Score` as an argument. `Score` is queried during
   the route-finding process, returning the absolute amounts which you are
   willing to pay to avoid routing over a given channel. As a default, a
   `Scorer` is provided which returns a constant amount, with a suggested
   default of 500 msat. This translates to a willingness to pay up to 500 msat
   in additional fees per hop in order to avoid additional hops (#1124).
 * `Event::PaymentPathFailed` now contains a `short_channel_id` field which may
   be filled in with a channel that can be &quot;blamed&quot; for the payment failure.
   Payment retries should likely avoid the given channel for some time (#1077).
 * `PublicKey`s in `NetworkGraph` have been replaced with a `NodeId` struct
   which contains only a simple `[u8; 33]`, substantially improving
   `NetworkGraph` deserialization performance (#1107).
 * `ChainMonitor`'s `HashMap` of `ChannelMonitor`s is now private, exposed via
   `Chainmonitor::get_monitor` and `ChainMonitor::list_monitors` instead
   (#1112).
 * When an outbound channel is closed prior to the broadcasting of its funding
   transaction, but after you call
   `ChannelManager::funding_transaction_generated`, a new event type,
   `Event::DiscardFunding`, is generated, informing you the transaction was not
   broadcasted and that you can spend the same inputs again elsewhere (#1098).
 * `ChannelManager::create_channel` now returns the temporary channel ID which
   may later appear in `Event::ChannelClosed` or `ChannelDetails` prior to the
   channel being funded (#1121).
 * `Event::PaymentSent` now contains the payment hash as well as the payment
   preimage (#1062).
 * `ReadOnlyNetworkGraph::get_addresses` now returns owned `NetAddress` rather
   than references. As a side-effect this method is now exposed in foreign
   language bindings (#1115).
 * The `Persist` and `ChannelMonitorUpdateErr` types have moved to the
   `lightning::chain::chainmonitor` and `lightning::chain` modules,
   respectively (#1112).
 * `ChannelManager::send_payment` now returns a `PaymentId` which identifies a
   payment (whether MPP or not) and can be used to retry the full payment or
   MPP parts through `retry_payment` (#1096). Note that doing so is currently
   *not* crash safe, and you may find yourself sending twice. It is recommended
   that you *not* use the `retry_payment` API until the next release.

## Bug Fixes
 * Due to an earlier fix for the Lightning dust inflation vulnerability tracked
   in CVE-2021-41591/CVE-2021-41592/CVE-2021-41593 in 0.0.100, we required
   counterparties to accept a dust limit slightly lower than the dust limit now
   required by other implementations. This appeared as, at least, latest lnd
   always refusing to accept channels opened by LDK clients (#1065).
 * If there are multiple channels available to the same counterparty,
   `get_route` would only consider the channel listed last as available for
   sending (#1100).
 * `Persist` implementations returning
   `ChannelMonitorUpdateErr::TemporaryFailure` from `watch_channel` previously
   resulted in the `ChannelMonitor` not being stored at all, resulting in a
   panic after monitor updating is complete (#1112).
 * If payments are pending awaiting forwarding at startup, an
   `Event::PendingHTLCsForwardable` event will always be provided. This ensures
   user code calls `ChannelManager::process_pending_htlc_fowards` even if it
   shut down while awaiting the batching timer during the previous run (#1076).
 * If a call to `ChannelManager::send_payment` failed due to lack of
   availability of funds locally, LDK would store the payment as pending
   forever, with no ability to retry or fail it, leaking memory (#1109).

## Serialization Compatibility
 * All above new Events/fields are ignored by prior clients. All above new
   Events/fields, except for `Event::PaymentSent::payment_hash` are not present
   when reading objects serialized by prior versions of the library.

## Running Bitcoin-S

If you want to run the standalone server binary, after verifying gpg signatures, you
can `unzip bitcoin-s-server-1.8.0.zip` and then run it with `./bin/bitcoin-s-server` to start the node. You will need to
configure the node properly first, you can find example
configurations [here](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/config/configuration#example-configuration-file).

You can then unzip the `bitcoin-s-cli-1.8.0.zip` folder and start using the `bitcoin-s-cli` like this:

```bashrc
./bin/bitcoin-s-cli --help
Usage: bitcoin-s-cli [options] [&lt;cmd&gt;]

  -n, --network &lt;value&gt;    Select the active network.
  --debug                  Print debugging information
  --rpcport &lt;value&gt;        The port to send our rpc request to on the server
  -h, --help               Display this help message and exit
```

For more information on what commands `bitcoin-s-cli` supports check the documentation, here is where to
start: https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/applications/server#server-endpoints

## Verifying signatures

This release is signed with [Chris's signing key](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/security#disclosure) with
fingerprint `339A49229576050819083EB3F99724872F822910`

To do the verification, first hash the executable using `sha256sum`. You should check that the result is listed in
the `SHA256SUMS.asc` file next to its file name. After doing that you can use `gpg --verify` to authenticate the
signature.

Example:

```
$ sha256sum bitcoin-s-server-1.8.0.zip
9c130e51c0ca60021021ea48fab9fa2eae3797bafb1a4c022b3a2cd6d17446a0  bitcoin-s-server-1.8.0.zip
$ sha256sum bitcoin-s-cli-1.8.0.zip
5dd0953ed92b03621ed5e359b1f03a2bc25fe1d636854103c4fab4ae1c952daa  bitcoin-s-cli-1.8.0.zip
$ gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
gpg: Signature made Thu 24 Sep 2020 12:49:39 PM CDT
gpg:                using RSA key 339A49229576050819083EB3F99724872F822910

# Executive Summary

This release integrates Tor network support for opening a DLC with your counterparty.
This is a huge UX improvement over the previous flow where 2 _manual_ round trips
were required to open a DLC with your peer.

See individual module sections for updates on per module basis.

## app commons 

Most changes in app commons this release is related to refactoring code so that
it can be used more generically across the code base.

bfbde2abaa Add appCommonsTest to windows test matrix (#3683)

0fb2cd0149 Remove implicit conversions from BitcoinSAppConfig -&gt; {WalletAppConfig,ChainAppConfig,NodeAppConfig} etc (#3652)

4f7b6422ea 2021 08 06 app config refacotr (#3498)

## App server

The app server is the headless backend for bitcoin-s. This runs our wallet, node
and chain management modules.

The biggest change this release is integrating end to end automated negotiation for entering
into DLCs in PR #3462. This means you can just give your tor address and an offer to a peer
and they will be able to enter into a DLC with you automatically.

This release included deprecating old endpoints that were poorly named and renaming them
to have an announcement suffix. For instance `createenumevent` -&gt; `createenumannouncement`.

The old endpoints will be removed next release. For more information see #3703 .

New rpcs added this release are 

- `getversion` - returns versions of bitcoin-s
- `backupwallet` - backs up the wallet to the provided destination
- `createcontractinfo` - creates a contract info based on oracle, total collateral and payouts
- `decodeoffer` - decodes a dlc offer
- `decodeannouncement` - decodes an oracle announcement
- `decodeattestments` - decodes oracle's attestments

7a3497ab9c 2021 10 15 createcontractinfo numeric (#3758)

80d498d288 Fix bug where getbalances was always retruning sats (#3750)

## bitcoind rpc

The major changes this module breaking up `BitcoindInstance` 
to `BitcoindInstanceLocal` and `BitcoindInstanceRemote`. These require different
parameters. We can do much more with a locally running bitcoind instance.

We also can now fetch the version of a running bitcoind instance.

781e77844f Implement ability to get proper version of BitcoindRpcClient from BitcoindRpcApConfig.clientF (#3699)

0746b14331 Move BitcoindRpcAppConfig into the bitcoind-rpc project (#3610)

## Build 

We now publish docker images that are available on arm64 as well as amd64.

We also allow docker containers to take a `BITCOIN_S_KEYMANAGER_ENTROPY`.
This is useful for platforms like umbrel that allow external entropy to be
provided by the platform. See #3679 for more information.

e17ea32faa Update base docker image to openjdk:16-slim (#3650)

8e39b2bbb8 Sbt docker multi platform (#3649)

fd7cd71848 Update .gitmodules (#3390)

2597904019 Move DLCWalletApi to core module (#3438)

9aa9a424c2 Implement init message from BOLT 1 (#3407)

## Db commons 

The release for db commons adds a new class `MasterXPubDAO` that allows you to store the
master xpub for a specific module like the `wallet` or `dlcOracle`. If a different 
seed is used on statup, an exception will be thrown saying that the stored master xpub
and the xpub generated from the seed are different. 

6df0354a73 Enable WAL mode for SQLite (#3704)

48213d9b81 Implement MasterXPubDAO (#3451)


## DLC node

This is a new module. This implements the networking logic to negotiate the building
of Contract Execution Transactions (CET) and the funding transaction for a DLC.

1051e6365a DLC P2P Client (#3402)

## DLC Oracle

This release for DLC oracle focuses on making sure our `DLCOracle` construction is safe.
Previously we could seed the oracle with entropy that doesn't correspond to entropy on disk
or passed via the `BITCOIN_S_KEYMANAGER_ENTROPY` flag.

One other bug fix in this release is making sure we increment the keyIndex in a thread safe way.

2d96a9c519 Fix typo in DLCOracle (#3434)

91b88b60ec Add large digits test in DLCOracle (#3432)

ea1ead9a3f Add nonces to error message for easier debugging (#3430)

b7b2a7099f 2021 07 15 dlc oracle pg (#3413)

## DLC wallet

Bug fixes this release. The most notable is preserving the ordering of inputs when multiple

9668358807 2021 10 04 issue 3715 (#3724)

inputs are used to fund the DLC from one counterparty (#3647)

a295b363bd Fix bug where we couldn't execute a DLC twice (#3426)

892096d790 Disallow calling addDLCSigs as Initiator (#3411)

## fee provider

BitGo removed some objects from the result they return from their API

3ffa997cc7 remove fields from BitGoResult (#3739)

## gui 

Tons of improvements to the GUI. Our thinking on the GUI is to re-write it in typescript.
We will continue to support for the desktop GUI for now, will the goal of phasing it out
over the long term.

external entropy for the modules that depend on the keymanager. These modules
are the `wallet` and `dlcOracle` as of this writing.

## node

This release of `node` lays the groundwork for multi peer block filter lite client (#3401).
This functionality is not usable yet, but will be in the release of bitcoin-s.

This release also includes P2P reconnection logic. Previously you would have to restart the 
node to re-connect with a peer (#3572).

99107b61ea Add PeerDAO (#3738)

## Oracle explorer client

Updates the API used by oracle explorer client to be `v2`. Suredbits
released this API recently. [See the API docs for more info](https://gist.github.com/Christewart/a9e55d9ba582ac9a5ceffa96db9d7e1f)

ab8649a6a1 update oracle explorer client to use v2 of the API (#3747)

## Oracle server

This release adds two new endpoint for the oracle server in #3701

**_WARNING_**

These endpoints should be used VERY carefully. You can reveal your private key if you delete
attestations that were widely shared if you re-attest with a different value. Deleting
an announcement that users have built DLCs based on will mean those DLCs will have to exercise
the refund clause. If you don't know what you are doing, it's best to not use these endpoints.

- `deleteannouncement` - deletes the announcement
- `deleteattestation` - deletes the attestations for an announcement

6aff01ffbf createattesattion -&gt; signenum (#3712)

3d725adc92 2021 09 29 delete announcement (#3701)

    <summary># Eclair v0.6.2

This releases fixes a known vulnerability, makes several performance improvements, includes a few bug fixes and many new features.
It is fully compatible with 0.6.1 (and all previous versions of eclair).

This release requires a few actions from node operators when upgrading: make sure you read the release notes carefully!

The release notes can be found [here](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/blob/master/docs/release-notes/eclair-v0.6.2.md).

## Verifying signatures

You will need `gpg` and our release signing key 7A73FE77DE2C4027. Note that you can get it:

- from our website: https://acinq.co/pgp/drouinf.asc
- from github user @sstone, a committer on eclair: https://api.github.com/users/sstone/gpg_keys

To import our signing key:

```sh
$ gpg --import drouinf.asc
```

To verify the release file checksums and signatures:

```sh
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped
```

## Building

Eclair builds are deterministic. To reproduce our builds, please use the following environment (*):

- Ubuntu 20.04
- AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.6
- Maven 3.8.1

Use the following command to generate the eclair-node package:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

That should generate `eclair-node/target/eclair-node-0.6.2-6817d6f-bin.zip` with sha256 checksums that match the one we provide and sign in `SHA256SUMS.asc`

(*) You may be able to build the exact same artefacts with other operating systems or versions of JDK 11, we have not tried everything.

## Upgrading

This release is fully compatible with previous eclair versions. You don't need to close your channels, just stop eclair, upgrade and restart.</summary>

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.13.3-beta"/>
    <summary># Security Fixes

This release contains a security fix for [CVE-2021-41593](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41593) which would allow an attacker to cause loss of funds through a griefing vector related to high accepted dust values. This release addresses the issue by enforcing stricter clamps on accepted dust values during channel funding, and also adds `hltcswitch` level dust accounting to limit the total dust exposure (triggered by an instantaneous force close) at any moment. The default allotted fully forwarded dust exposure level is set at `500k sats`, this value can be tweaked with a new config flag: `--dust-threshold=`. 

If upgrading is not possible to prevent CVE-2021-41593, the [`dust-tool`](https://github.com/lightninglabs/dust-tool) can intercept bad `open_channel` parameters and reject them via our `ChannelAcceptor`. In addition, it can also scan your node's current set of confirmed channels and recommend closing potentially risky ones out.

Alternatively, your node's advertised `min_htlc` value can be increased to ensure it is well above all the dust limits of its active channels. 

# Database Migrations
This release does not contain any database migrations.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.13.3-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.sig manifest-v0.13.3-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Mon Oct  4 08:20:20 2021 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]

```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.16.3`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, `watchtowerrpc` and `monitoring`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.13.3-beta
gpg: Signature made Mo 04 Okt 2021 16:08:05 CEST
gpg:                using RSA key F4FC70F07310028424EFC20A8E4256593F177720
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Oliver Gugger &lt;gugger@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [unknown]
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.13.3-beta /verify-install.sh v0.13.3-beta
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.13.3-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.13.3-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.3-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.3-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

### New Assets
No new assets were added.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.7.4.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.7.4-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.7.4.jar.txt file.

There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.7.4.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 11.0.10 and the v1.7.4 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.7.4.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning/releases/tag/v0.0.101"/>
    <summary>## API Updates
 * Custom message types are now supported directly in the `PeerManager`,
   allowing you to send and receive messages of any type that is not natively
   understood by LDK. This requires a new type bound on `PeerManager`, a
   `CustomMessageHandler`. `IgnoringMessageHandler` provides a simple default
   for this new bound for ignoring unknown messages (#1031, #1074).
 * Route graph updates as a result of failed payments are no longer provided as
   `MessageSendEvent::PaymentFailureNetworkUpdate` but instead included in a
   new field in the `Event::PaymentFailed` events. Generally, this means route
   graph updates are no longer handled as a part of the `PeerManager` but
   instead through the new `EventHandler` implementation for
   `NetGraphMsgHandler`. To make this easy, a new parameter to
   `lightning-background-processor::BackgroundProcessor::start` is added, which
   contains an `Option`al `NetGraphmsgHandler`. If provided as `Some`, relevant
   events will be processed by the `NetGraphMsgHandler` prior to normal event
   handling (#1043).
 * `NetworkGraph` is now, itself, thread-safe. Accordingly, most functions now
   take `&amp;self` instead of `&amp;mut self` and the graph data can be accessed
   through `NetworkGraph.read_only` (#1043).
 * The balances available on-chain to claim after a channel has been closed are
   now exposed via `ChannelMonitor::get_claimable_balances` and
   `ChainMonitor::get_claimable_balances`. The second can be used to get
   information about all closed channels which still have on-chain balances
   associated with them. See enum variants of `ln::channelmonitor::Balance` and
   method documentation for the above methods for more information on the types
   of balances exposed (#1034).
 * When one HTLC of a multi-path payment fails, the new field `all_paths_failed`
   in `Event::PaymentFailed` is set to `false`. This implies that the payment
   has not failed, but only one part. Payment resolution is only indicated by an
   `Event::PaymentSent` event or an `Event::PaymentFailed` with
   `all_paths_failed` set to `true`, which is also set for the last remaining
   part of a multi-path payment (#1053).
 * To better capture the context described above, `Event::PaymentFailed` has
   been renamed to `Event::PaymentPathFailed` (#1084).
 * A new event, `ChannelClosed`, is provided by `ChannelManager` when a channel
   is closed, including a reason and error message (if relevant, #997).
 * `lightning-invoice` now considers invoices with sub-millisatoshi precision
   to be invalid, and requires millisatoshi values during construction (thus
   you must call `amount_milli_satoshis` instead of `amount_pico_btc`, #1057).
 * The `BaseSign` interface now includes two new hooks which provide additional
   information about commitment transaction signatures and revocation secrets
   provided by our counterparty, allowing additional verification (#1039).
 * The `BaseSign` interface now includes additional information for cooperative
   close transactions, making it easier for a signer to verify requests (#1064).
 * `Route` has two additional helper methods to get fees and amounts (#1063).
 * `Txid` and `Transaction` objects can now be deserialized from responses when
   using the HTTP client in the `lightning-block-sync` crate (#1037, #1061).

## Bug Fixes
 * Fix a panic when reading a lightning invoice with a non-recoverable
   signature. Further, restrict lightning invoice parsing to require payment
   secrets and better handle a few edge cases as required by BOLT 11 (#1057).
 * Fix a panic when receiving multiple messages (such as HTLC fulfill messages)
   after a call to `chain::Watch::update_channel` returned
   `Err(ChannelMonitorUpdateErr::TemporaryFailure)` with no
   `ChannelManager::channel_monitor_updated` call in between (#1066).
 * For multi-path payments, `Event::PaymentSent` is no longer generated
   multiple times, once for each independent part (#1053).
 * Multi-hop route hints in invoices are now considered in the default router
   provided via `get_route` (#1040).
 * The time peers have to respond to pings has been increased when building
   with debug assertions enabled. This avoids peer disconnections on slow hosts
   when running in debug mode (#1051).
 * The timeout for the first byte of a response for requests from the
   `lightning-block-sync` crate has been increased to 300 seconds to better
   handle the long hangs in Bitcoin Core when it syncs to disk (#1090).

## Serialization Compatibility
 * Due to a bug in 0.0.100, `Event`s written by 0.0.101 which are of a type not
   understood by 0.0.100 may lead to `Err(DecodeError::InvalidValue)` or corrupt
   deserialized objects in 0.100. Such `Event`s will lead to an
   `Err(DecodeError::InvalidValue)` in versions prior to 0.0.100. The only such
   new event written by 0.0.101 is `Event::ChannelClosed` (#1087).
 * Payments that were initiated in versions prior to 0.0.101 may still
   generate duplicate `PaymentSent` `Event`s or may have spurious values for
   `Event::PaymentPathFailed::all_paths_failed` (#1053).
 * The return values of `ChannelMonitor::get_claimable_balances` (and, thus,
   `ChainMonitor::get_claimable_balances`) may be spurious for channels where
   the spend of the funding transaction appeared on chain while running a
   version prior to 0.0.101. `Balance` information should only be relied upon
   for channels that were closed while running 0.0.101+ (#1034).
 * Payments failed while running versions prior to 0.0.101 will never have a
   `Some` for the `network_update` field (#1043).

### New Assets
No new assets were added.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.7.3.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.7.3-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.7.3.jar.txt file.

*NEW: There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.7.3.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 11.0.10 and the v1.7.3 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.*

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.7.3.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning/releases/tag/v0.0.100"/>
    <summary>## API Updates
 * The `lightning` crate can now be built in no_std mode, making it easy to
   target embedded hardware for rust users. Note that mutexes are replaced with
   no-ops for such builds (#1008, #1028).
 * LDK now supports sending and receiving &quot;keysend&quot; payments. This includes
   modifications to `lightning::util::events::Event::PaymentReceived` to
   indicate the type of payment (#967).
 * A new variant, `lightning::util::events::Event::PaymentForwarded` has been
   added which indicates a forwarded payment has been successfully claimed and
   we've received a forwarding fee (#1004).
 * `lightning::chain::keysinterface::KeysInterface::get_shutdown_pubkey` has
   been renamed to `get_shutdown_scriptpubkey`, returns a script, and is now
   called on channel open only if
   `lightning::util::config::ChannelConfig::commit_upfront_shutdown_pubkey` is
   set (#1019).
 * Closing-signed negotiation is now more configurable, with an explicit
   `lightning::util::config::ChannelConfig::force_close_avoidance_max_fee_satoshis`
   field allowing you to select the maximum amount you are willing to pay to
   avoid a force-closure. Further, we are now less restrictive on the fee
   placed on the closing transaction when we are not the party paying it. To
   control the feerate paid on a channel at close-time, use
   `ChannelManager::close_channel_with_target_feerate` instead of
   `close_channel` (#1011).
 * `lightning_background_processor::BackgroundProcessor` now stops the
   background thread when dropped (#1007). It is marked `#[must_use]` so that
   Rust users will receive a compile-time warning when it is immediately
   dropped after construction (#1029).
 * Total potential funds burn on force-close due to dust outputs is now limited
   to `lightning::util::config::ChannelConfig::max_dust_htlc_exposure_msat` per
   channel (#1009).
 * The interval on which
   `lightning::ln::peer_handler::PeerManager::timer_tick_occurred` should be
   called has been reduced to once every five seconds (#1035) and
   `lightning::ln::channelmanager::ChannelManager::timer_tick_occurred` should
   now be called on startup in addition to once per minute (#985).
 * The rust-bitcoin and bech32 dependencies have been updated to their
   respective latest versions (0.27 and 0.8, #1012).

## Bug Fixes
 * Fix panic when reading invoices generated by some versions of c-lightning
   (#1002 and #1003).
 * Fix panic when attempting to validate a signed message of incorrect length
   (#1010).
 * Do not ignore the route hints in invoices when the invoice is over 250k
   sats (#986).
 * Fees are automatically updated on outbound channels to ensure commitment
   transactions are always broadcastable (#985).
 * Fixes a rare case where a `lightning::util::events::Event::SpendableOutputs`
   event is not generated after a counterparty commitment transaction is
   confirmed in a reorg when a conflicting local commitment transaction is
   removed in the same reorg (#1022).
 * Fixes a remotely-triggerable force-closure of an origin channel after an
   HTLC was forwarded over a next-hop channel and the next-hop channel was
   force-closed by our counterparty (#1025).
 * Fixes a rare force-closure case when sending a payment as a channel fundee
   when overdrawing our remaining balance. Instead the send will fail (#998).
 * Fixes a rare force-closure case when a payment was claimed prior to a
   peer disconnection or restart, and later failed (#977).

## Serialization Compatibility
 * Pending inbound keysend payments which have neither been failed nor claimed
   when serialized will result in a `ChannelManager` which is not readable on
   pre-0.0.100 clients (#967).
 * Because
   `lightning::chain::keysinterface::KeysInterface::get_shutdown_scriptpubkey`
   has been updated to return a script instead of only a `PublicKey`,
   `ChannelManager`s constructed with custom `KeysInterface` implementations on
   0.0.100 and later versions will not be readable on previous versions.
   `ChannelManager`s created with 0.0.99 and prior versions will remain readable
   even after the a serialization roundtrip on 0.0.100, as long as no new
   channels are opened. Further, users using a
   `lightning::chain::keysinterface::KeysManager` as their `KeysInterface` will
   have `ChannelManager`s which are readable on prior versions as well (#1019).
 * `ChannelMonitorUpdate`s created by 0.0.100 and later for channels when
   `lightning::util::config::ChannelConfig::commit_upfront_shutdown_pubkey` is
   not set may not be readable by versions prior to 0.0.100 (#1019).
 * HTLCs which were in the process of being claimed on-chain when a pre-0.0.100
   `ChannelMonitor` was serialized may generate `PaymentForwarded` events with
   spurious `fee_earned_msat` values. This only applies to payments which were
   unresolved at the time of the upgrade (#1004).
 * 0.0.100 clients with pending `Event::PaymentForwarded` events at
   serialization-time will generate serialized `ChannelManager` objects which
   0.0.99 and earlier clients cannot read. The likelihood of this can be reduced
   by ensuring you process all pending events immediately before serialization
   (as is done by the `lightning-background-processor` crate, #1004).

    <link href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/releases/tag/v0.10.1"/>
    <summary>We're pleased to announce the 0.10.1 release of c-lightning, named by @nalinbhardwaj.

This is a *recommended* upgrade: payment secrets in invoices are now compulsory, and offers and dual funding drafts have been updated, so these (experimental) features are incompatible with previous releases!

*NOTE*: Users of the rebalance or drain [plugins](https://github.com/lightningd/plugins) MUST update, as payment secret is now compulsory.

## Highlights for Users

- `experimental-dual-fund` allows advertizement of funding rates which we will contribute to channels automatically, on a 1-month lease.
- `withdraw` and `close` (if peer supports) now supports Taproot (and other future) addresses.
- `listchannels` can now be queried by destination, as well as source.
- `plugin rescan` now automatically reloads plugins which have changed.
- We try to restart automatically if we notice subdaemons have been upgraded underneath us.
- `fundpsbt` will no longer include uneconomic UTXOs (unless `all`).
- `close` will return a stream of notifications if there is a delay in closing.
- Unilateral close feerates were reduced from bitcoind's &quot;2 CONSERVATIVE&quot; to &quot;6 ECONOMICAL&quot;.
- Tor v2 is deprecated: please upgrade to v3!
- Fixed disconnection bug when an HTLC failed.
- Fixed bug in rapid feerate changes, and make code space them out (LND compat).
- Fixed bug where Tor on different ports could be advertized incorrectly.
- Fixed various bugs to make `pay` more robust.

## Highlights for the Network

- payment secrets in invoices are now compulsory, finally closing a potential probing (or, with amountless invoices, stealing) attack.
- `option_shutdown_anysegwit` allows peers to close channels to any future segwit version address (taproot!).
- `keysend` now understands routehints, for routing to unpublished nodes, and sets the final CLTV to 22, for rust-lightning nodes.
- `invoice` now allows creation of wumbo invoices (&gt; 0.0429 BTC).
- We will now discuss old channels with peers who reconnect, even if we consider them closed.


## Highlights for Developers

- Manual pages now document *exactly* the JSON you can expect from each command (and it's tested!)
- Plugins can now publish notifications for other plugins to listen to.
- `force-feerates` allows complete feerate override (mainly for regtest), and a bug fixed where we could send 0 update_fee on regtest.
- The HSM daemon is now separated into libhsmd, which also provides Python bindings.
- `createonion` can now make variable-sized onions, and `sendonion` no longer requires `direction` and `channel` for `firsthop`.
- `dev-sendcustommsg` is now simply `sendcustommsg`.
- Many offers API improvements and updates, including unsigned offers (smaller QR codes!).

More details can be found in the [changelog](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/v0.10.1/CHANGELOG.md).

Thanks to everyone for their contributions and bug reports; please keep them coming.

Since 0.10.0, we've had 526 commits from 15 different authors over 114 days.

A special thanks goes to the 6 first time contributors:

- Nalin Bhardwa 
- Nathanael 
- LightningHelper
- OpenOms
- Urza 
- Valentine Wallace

Cheers,
Lisa, Christian,  ZmnSCPxj, Rusty.</summary>

    <summary>## Main changes

### Extract invoices from images stored on device

You can now browse the device's file system (using the device's browser, hence not needing any permissions) to load an image containing a Lightning invoice (or a Bitcoin URI, or a LNURL) and read the invoice as usual. This is useful when trying to pay someone using a QR code image shared over the internet, for example on Twitter.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.7.2.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.7.2-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.7.2.jar.txt file.

*NEW: There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.7.2.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 11.0.10 and the v1.7.2 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.*

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.7.2.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

  <entry>
    <id>https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.13.1-beta</id>
    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.13.1-beta"/>
    <summary>This marks the first minor release of the 0.13.x cycle. This release is primarily a maintenance release including several bug fixes that didn't make it into 0.13.0, a series of fixes for introduced regressions, and a few small optimizations.



# Database Migrations

This release does not contain any database migrations.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.1-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.13.1-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.1-beta.sig manifest-v0.13.1-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Mon Jul 19 23:41:37 2021 CEST
gpg: using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun laolu32@gmail.com&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.1-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.1-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.1-beta.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.16.3`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, `watchtowerrpc` and `monitoring`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.13.1-beta
gpg: Signature made Mon 19 Jul 2021 06:04:34 PM UTC using RSA key ID 9B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot;
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker pull lightninglabs/lnd:v0.13.1-beta
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.13.1-beta /verify-install.sh
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.13.1-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.13.1-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.1-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.1-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

    <link href="https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/releases/tag/v0.6.1"/>
    <summary># Eclair v0.6.1

This release makes major performance improvements, includes a few bug fixes and several new features.
It is fully compatible with 0.6.0 (and all previous versions of eclair).

# Major changes

### Performance improvements

#### Sqlite

Eclair now uses [write-ahead logging](https://sqlite.org/wal.html) in Sqlite (#1871). WAL is better suited to our DB access patterns, and is both much more performant and safer than the default [rollback journal](https://sqlite.org/lockingv3.html#rollback) that we were using previously.
&gt; 1. WAL is significantly faster in most scenarios.
&gt; 2. WAL provides more concurrency as readers do not block writers and a writer does not block readers.
&gt; 3. Disk I/O operations tends to be more sequential using WAL.
&gt; 4. WAL uses many fewer fsync() operations.
 
This small change improves performance by more than 5x.

#### Payment Handling

Invoice generation (#1878) and handling of incoming payments (#1880) are now processed in parallel, resulting in a higher throughput under load.

### Improved Postgres support

This is the continuation of an effort to make PosgreSQL production-ready. The database schema has been reworked (#1866) and is now better organized, with appropriate types for timestamps (#1862). There have been several concurrency-related bug fixes.

We  have also added `JSONB` columns for local channels and for network announcements (#1865). All individual data fields can now be accessed from SQL and indexed, which is very convenient for advanced analysis and tuning of a routing node.

### Upfront shutdown script

This release adds support for `option_upfront_shutdown_script` (feature bits 4/5).
This feature lets you specify a closing address when you open a channel: your peer will ensure that when you close, your funds can only go to that address.

It can be useful to protect against future hacks of your node, because the attacker won't be able to close your channels and send the funds to an address that he controls. However, it doesn't prevent the attacker from exfiltrating funds by paying lightning invoices, so you shouldn't rely on this feature alone to make your node hack-proof.

This option is disabled by default, but can be enabled in your `eclair.conf`.
Note that if you enable it, the closing address will be automatically generated by your `bitcoind` node.

### Transaction publishing improvements

This release reworks our internal transaction publishing architecture (see #1844 for details).
The new architecture is more flexible, provides better logging and makes it easy to add dynamic fee bumping in the future for anchor output channels.
It will also make it easier to automatically use CPFP to ensure funding transactions confirm before the [2016 blocks timeout](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/839) is reached.

### API changes

This release updates a few APIs:

- `parseinvoice` displays Bolt 11 invoices routing hints (#1833)
- Plugins can inject their own routes into the API instead of spawning a separate HTTP server (#1805 and #1819)

### Miscellaneous improvements and bug fixes

- Eclair now uses Bitcoin Core 0.21.1 by default (#taproot)
- Eclair now supports [warning messages](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/834)
- Eclair uses additional entropy on top of the operating system RNG to mitigate random number generation failures (#1774)

# Verifying signatures

You will need `gpg` and our release signing key 7A73FE77DE2C4027. Note that you can get it:

- from our website: https://acinq.co/pgp/drouinf.asc
- from github user @sstone, a committer on eclair: https://api.github.com/users/sstone/gpg_keys

To import our signing key:

```sh
$ gpg --import drouinf.asc
```

To verify the release file checksums and signatures:

```sh
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped
```

# Building

Eclair builds are deterministic. To reproduce our builds, please use the following environment (*):

- Ubuntu 20.04
- AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.6
- Maven 3.8.1

Use the following command to generate the eclair-node package:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

That should generate `eclair-node/target/eclair-node-0.6.1-XXXXXXX-bin.zip` with sha256 checksums that match the one we provide and sign in `SHA256SUMS.asc`

(*) You may be able to build the exact same artefacts with other operating systems or versions of JDK 11, we have not tried everything.

# Upgrading

This release is fully compatible with eclair v0.6.0. You don't need to close your channels, just stop eclair, upgrade and restart.

    <summary>
## API Updates

 * `lightning_block_sync::poll::Validate` is now public, allowing you to
   implement the `lightning_block_sync::poll::Poll` trait without
   `lightning_block_sync::poll::ChainPoller` (#956).
 * `lightning::ln::peer_handler::PeerManager` no longer requires that no calls
   are made to referencing the same `SocketDescriptor` after
   `disconnect_socket` returns. This makes the API significantly less
   deadlock-prone and simplifies `SocketDescriptor` implementations
   significantly. The relevant changes have been made to `lightning_net_tokio`
   and `PeerManager` documentation has been substantially rewritten (#957).
 * `lightning::util::message_signing`'s `sign` and `verify` methods now take
   secret and public keys by reference instead of value (#974).
 * Substantially more information is now exposed about channels in
   `ChannelDetails`. See documentation for more info (#984 and #988).
 * The latest best block seen is now exposed in
   `ChannelManager::current_best_block` and
   `ChannelMonitor::current_best_block` (#984).
 * Feerates charged when forwarding payments over channels is now set in
   `ChannelConfig::fee_base_msat` when the channel is opened. For existing
   channels, the value is set to the value provided in
   `ChannelManagerReadArgs::default_config::channel_options` the first time the
   `ChannelManager` is loaded in 0.0.99 (#975).
 * We now reject HTLCs which are received to be forwarded over private channels
   unless `UserConfig::accept_forwards_to_priv_channels` is set. Note that
   `UserConfig` is never serialized and must be provided via
   `ChannelManagerReadArgs::default_config` at each start (#975).

## Bug Fixes

 * We now forward gossip messages to peers instead of only relaying
   locally-generated gossip or sending gossip messages during initial sync
   (#948).
 * Correctly send `channel_update` messages to direct peers on private channels
   (#949). Without this, a private node connected to an LDK node over a private
   channel cannot receive funds as it does not know which fees the LDK node
   will charge.
 * `lightning::ln::channelmanager::ChannelManager` no longer expects to be
   persisted spuriously after we receive a `channel_update` message about any
   channel in the routing gossip (#972).
 * Asynchronous `ChannelMonitor` updates (using the
   `ChannelMonitorUpdateErr::TemporaryFailure` return variant) no longer cause
   spurious HTLC forwarding failures (#954).
 * Transaction provided via `ChannelMonitor::transactions_confirmed`
   after `ChannelMonitor::best_block_updated` was called for a much later
   block now trigger all relevant actions as of the later block. Previously
   some transaction broadcasts or other responses required an additional
   block be provided via `ChannelMonitor::best_block_updated` (#970).
 * We no longer panic in rare cases when an invoice contained last-hop route
   hints which were unusable (#958).

## Node Compatibility

 * We now accept spurious `funding_locked` messages sent prior to
   `channel_reestablish` messages after reconnect. This is a
   [known, long-standing bug in lnd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/4006)
   (#966).
 * We now set the `first_blocknum` and `number_of_blocks` fields in
   `reply_channel_range` messages to values which c-lightning versions prior to
   0.10 accepted. This avoids spurious force-closes from such nodes (#961).

## Serialization Compatibility

 * Due to a bug discovered in 0.0.98, if a `ChannelManager` is serialized on
   version 0.0.98 while an `Event::PaymentSent` is pending processing, the
   `ChannelManager` will fail to deserialize both on version 0.0.98 and later
   versions. If you have such a `ChannelManager` available, a simple patch will
   allow it to deserialize. Please file an issue if you need assistance (#973).</summary>

## Running Bitcoin-S

If you want to run the standalone server binary, after verifying gpg signatures, you
can `unzip bitcoin-s-server-1.7.0.zip` and then run it with `./bin/bitcoin-s-server` to start the node. You will need to
configure the node properly first, you can find example
configurations [here](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/config/configuration#example-configuration-file).

For more information on what commands `bitcoin-s-cli` supports check the documentation, here is where to
start: https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/applications/server#server-endpoints

## Verifying signatures

This release is signed with [Chris's signing key](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/security#disclosure) with
fingerprint `339A49229576050819083EB3F99724872F822910`

Example:

```

# Executive Summary

## DLC Wallet

This release merges our feature branch called `adaptor-dlc` into master. This means 
that all DLC features are now in our `master` branch.

## Installers

We now support installers for mac, windows, and linux (deb) builds. Everytime a PR is merged into master, 
we publish artifacts for that commit. For more information, please see our [website](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/getting-started#java-binaries)

With these installers, you can install the bitcoin-s wallet and start using DLCs with a rudimentary GUI.
In future releases, we will be iterating and improving the GUI user experience.

## Versioning changes

To support publishing artifacts for both mac and windows, we had to drop the leading `v` on our version scheme.
We also were required by apple to add a leading `1` to our version scheme. Thus, this release will be `1.7.0`
rather than the expected version of `v0.7.0`.

## New modules

### DLC wallet 

This new module contains all logic for our DLC Wallet

### Tor

We are beginning to integrate TOR support into bitcoin-s to for a variety of reasons.
In this release, we have added bare bones support, in future releases we will be integrating
this deeper into other modules.

## Bundle

Bundle combines both the GUI and AppServer project and bundles them together to make a standalone application.
One problem we encountered this release is how to allow users to configure their node from the GUI on first startup.

In #3142 we added support for this by adding a new configuration file that is automatically generated and written
to `~/.bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s-bundle.conf`. This file saves the user's configuration, and uses it the next
time the bundle is started.

bc79a24f532 Get both bundle and app server logging working (#3362)

2f7e5876d30 Set default neutrino peer based on network (#3360)

## Cli

42966b3cbe6 Remove logback from the cli module (#3117)

## Core

Most changes in the `core` module this release is related to optimizing adaptor point computations.
This is very important as when doing numeric DLCs we have to generate thousands of points.
We use parallelism to speed up this computation.

The other notable change in `core` is adding `DLCAccounting`. This is used to caclulate things like PNL
and rate of return for a DLC you were in.

### Assets
No new assets.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.7.0.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.7.0-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.7.0.jar.txt file.

*NEW: There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.7.0.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 11.0.10 and the v1.7.0 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.*

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.7.0.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning/releases/tag/v0.0.98"/>
    <summary>0.0.98 should be considered a release candidate to the first alpha release of Rust-Lightning and the broader LDK. It represents several years of work designing and fine-tuning a flexible API for integrating lightning into any application. LDK should make it easy to build a lightning node or client which meets specific requirements that other lightning node software cannot. As lightning continues to evolve, and new use-cases for lightning develop, the API of LDK will continue to change and expand. However, starting with version 0.1, objects serialized with prior versions will be readable with the latest LDK. While Rust-Lightning is approaching the 0.1 milestone, language bindings components of LDK available at https://github.com/lightningdevkit are still of varying quality. Some are also approaching an 0.1 release, while others are still much more experimental. Please note that, at 0.0.98, using Rust-Lightning on mainnet is strongly discouraged.</summary>

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.13.0-beta"/>
    <summary>This release marks the first major release in the 0.13 series, and the second major release of the year! This release includes a number of compelling additions including: first-class pruning support, AMP sending+receiving support, arbitrary pubkey/xpub import w/ PSBT transaction crafting, clustered lnd using etcd failover, and much more!

# Database Migrations

The `lnd` database is migrated to store all wire messages with an additional TLV field. See details below.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already:

```shell
$ curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
$ curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.0-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.13.0-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```shell
$ gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.0-beta.sig manifest-v0.13.0-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```text
gpg: Signature made Thu Jun 17 09:48:09 2021 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]

```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp

From this new version onward, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.0-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the OpenTimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands:

```shell
$ ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.0-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.0-beta.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires.

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/release.md) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.16.3`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.

They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, and `watchtowerrpc`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.
The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used.

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```shell
$ git verify-tag v0.13.0-beta
gpg: Signature made Thu 17 Jun 2021 02:25:51 AM UTC using RSA key ID 9B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot;
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker pull lightninglabs/lnd:v0.13.0-beta
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.13.0-beta /verify-install.sh
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.13.0-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```shell
$ tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.13.0-beta.tar.gz
$ GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.0-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
$ GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.0-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory.

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191):

```shell
$ make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

# Release Notes

## Database and wire changes

### Wire Message TLV Support

The wire messages sent between LN peers have the ability to carry additional data, using the TLV format. This allows attaching data and protocol extensions to messages in a non-breaking way, paving the way for future feature upgrades to the protocol.

In this release all stored messages in the `lnd` database are [migrated to a format supporting these TLV extensions](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4923), and message parsing now always read out these fields and keep them for future handling.

## Protocol Updates

### Anchor Output Channels

The spec compliant anchor channel format introduced in v0.12 is now the default channel type if both nodes support it when opening a new channel. You can read more about it in the [v0.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.0-beta), and it can be disabled by providing the `--protocol.no-anchors` flag at startup.

Since a node having channels using this format must keep on-chain funds around in case unilateral fee bumping is needed, we reserve 10k sats per channel for this purpose. In this release we [cap this at `100k` sats](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5274), and in addition avoid reserving this value for private channels.

Finally a change to breach handling has been made, to mitigate a theoretical attack the channel peer can perform by [pinning HTLC outputs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/803) on a breached commitment transaction. If we suspect such pinning is taking place, lnd will now attempt to [sweep the breached commitment outputs separately](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5036).

## P2P Gossip Handling, Hardening &amp; Optimizations

### Ephemeral &amp; Persistent Gossip Reject Caches

Those that run larger lnd instances may have noticed a cyclic nature of gossip traffic that would lead to many announcements being rejected, only to be processed hours later. This burst of traffic typically causes high CPU and memory usage, along with a large batch of blocks fetched from the node backend.

During this release cycle we dug into the issue and found that the culprit was actually a new variant of zombie channel churn: fully closed channels (funding UTXO spent) being continually offered by nodes that aren't (for some reason) pruning their channel graph.

[In this release, we'll now add channels that fail full validation irrevocably to the existing zombie index cache](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5227). Expanding the usage of this cache means that new lnd nodes will only validate those spent channels once (as they should), then never request them again during the historical sync spot checks that happen periodically.

Related to the above fix, [a bug has been fixed that would cause us to continually re-validate a channel announcement that we had already rejected](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5192).

### Dependent Gossip Processing

`ChannelUpdate` and `NodeAnnouncement` gossip messages depend on its `ChannelAnnouncement` being processed successfully. Throughout our investigative efforts above, we also noticed that `lnd` would process these messages when their corresponding `ChannelAnnouncement`'s validation failed, which has now been [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5133/).

### Improved Gossip Rate Limiting

`lnd v0.12.1-beta` featured a new gossip rate limiting heuristic in which keep-alive updates were throttled to allow one per day, while non-keep-alive updates were throttled to allow one per block. The latter heuristic for non-keep-alive updates proved to be inconsistent, especially for our auto enable/disable channel behavior, as blocks are not guaranteed to arrive at a constant rate. To mitigate this, we've moved towards a token bucket based approach to allow by default one update per minute with a maximum burst tolerance of 10 updates. These defaults may change as the structure of the network does, but they can also be changed through two new config options: `gossip.channel-update-interval` and `gossip.max-channel-update-burst`.

## Routing Optimizations &amp; New Payment Types

### Atomic Multi-Path (AMP) Payments

This version of `lnd` introduces initial support for AMP payments, which is a generalized version of the experimental keysend protocol added in [`lnd-v0.9.0-beta`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.9.0-beta). While keysend payments must be fulfilled with a single HTLC, AMP offers the ability to perform multi-path spontaneous payments and leverage channel liquidity more effectively. It also offers an initial incarnation of [AMP invoices](#amp-invoices), which helps to facilitate spontaneous payments to private nodes, and serve as a basis for recurring payments down the road.

#### Receiving Spontaneous Payments

Users can set the `accept-amp=1` configuration option to automatically accept incoming, spontaneous AMP payments. Without setting this option, all spontaneous AMP payments will be rejected. Note that this setting is not required to accept one-time payments to an [AMP Invoice](#amp-invoices).

#### Sending Spontaneous Payments

Users can send spontaneous AMP payments to nodes with `accept-amp=1` using `lncli`, `routerrpc.SendToRouteV2`, or `routerrpc.SendPaymentV2`.

When paying with `lncli`: by including the `--amp` flag, payments only need to specify the amount and pubkey of the destiation, e.g. `lncli sendpayment --amt 100 --dest 0247a5b3b2f6794da6ab930974e3396fd9973aa7dc333ea8dd3b59fb71a70165be --amp`. This will only work for nodes in public channel graph, to pay private nodes see below regarding [AMP Invoices](#amp-invoices).

When paying with`routerrpc.SendPaymentV2`: when manually specifiying arguments, setting the [`Amp`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/ad0ecc4d581f282686fa3355ac1e8f8be63cc50b/lnrpc/routerrpc/router.pb.go#L478) flag to `true` and omitting the `PaymentHash` will cause `lnd` to initiate an AMP payment. This behavior can also be forced by providing an [AMP Invoice](#amp-invoices) in the [`PaymentRequest`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/routerrpc/router.pb.go#L400) field.

When paying with `routerrpc.SendToRouteV2`: users can force an AMP payment by setting [`AmpRecord`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/rpc.pb.go#L8321) field to a well crafted [`lnrpc.AmpRecord`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/rpc.pb.go#L8513) on the route's final [`lnrpc.Hop`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/rpc.pb.go#L8280).

#### AMP Invoices

In this version of `lnd`, we introduce a new concept of AMP invoices. Having invoices at all may seem counterintuitive to the spontaneous use case of AMP, however AMP invoices will provided two necessary use cases:
 - Offering the ability to pay _private_ nodes via AMP, by providing the sender with hop hints to reach the desination.
 - In the future, the ability to make recurring payments to an invoice, e.g. subscriptions, deposits/withdrawals, etc.

Full-blown recurring invoices are not implemented in this release, but will be available at a later point. For now an AMP invoice can only be settled by one payment. That said, this release does include support for simulating recurring payments, making the existing AMP invoices &quot;pseudo-reusable&quot;.

In order to do so, users can make payments via `routerrpc.SendPaymentV2` by passing in the (AMP) [`PaymentRequest`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/routerrpc/router.pb.go#L400), and providing an randomly-generated [`PaymentAddr`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/routerrpc/router.pb.go#L393). The external `PaymentAddr` will cause`lnd` to ignore the payment address provided in the invoice, and make a spontaneous payment using the rest of the parameters in the payment request. Note that the receiver must have `accept-amp=1` set, otherwise these subsequent payments will be ignored.

The default expiry for AMP invoices is set [30 days](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/4bb6cc9cee275e7f583039ead826d0fc6f6c4c33/lnrpc/invoicesrpc/addinvoice.go#L33). Users may wish to increase this duration using the [`Expiry`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/invoicesrpc/invoices.pb.go#L148) field to further amortize the setup costs of obtaining a new invoice.

### MPP+AMP Payment Splitting on by Default

[In this version of `lnd`, MPP/AMP payment splitting is now activated by default](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5017). Prior versions of `lnd` required a caller to _manually_ specify that they wanted their payment to possibly be split via the `MaxShards` RPC/CLI flag. The default number of attempted splits is now 16 (we'll attempt to split up to 16 times by default). In addition, a new `MaxShardAmt` flag has been added that allows the caller to control _how large_ the largest split can be. This new flag can effectively be used to force `lnd` to adhere to a given maximum payment unit expressed in satoshis, which means `lnd` may split more frequently than before.

### Strict Zombie Pruning

Typically lnd will mark a channel as a zombie when _both_ of its edges aren't re-advertised within a two week period. This is typically referred to as a channel's heartbeat update. [Analysis by Conner Fromknecht demonstrated that the channel graph itself could be shrunk by ~20%](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/767) if a stricter pruning heuristic was adopted: pruning a channel once only a single edge fails the heartbeat check. [The latest version of `lnd` has implemented this stricter pruning variant](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5138) in an opt-in manner.

This new graph pruning variant is on by default for neutrino nodes as it was common for them to never actually receive a &quot;double disable&quot; of a channel's edges, meaning it would never actually remove certain closed channels from its channel graph. Routing nodes and nodes that frequently send outbound payments can activate the new pruning variant with a new flag:
`--routing.strictgraphpruning`. The new logic also requires that party that originally failed the heartbeat check to the be one that re-publishes the channel update in order for a prior zombie channel to be resurrected. 

## New M1 Release Target 

[This is the first release that includes binaries for the recently released Apple Silicon (M1) architecture!](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5034) roasbeef has switched to using an M1 machine as his primary development machine over the past few months and hasn't reported any unsafe behavior. We encourage those switching to run lnd on an M1 machine to reach out to us if any abnormal behavior is detected.

For the 0.14 release, we aim to start to remove architectures for binaries included with the final packaged release that are either in the bottom tier of downloads, or have no downloads at all.

## P2P Networking

[A bug that wouldn't allow a node to listen on an IPv6 REST port when Tor is active](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/2541) has [been fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5007).

## Wallet Enhancements

This release features several improvements that will enable `lnd` (in a future release!) to operate without the access of private keys within its process.

### Watch-Only Key Import

The wallet is now able to [import BIP-0049 and BIP-0084 accounts/public keys as watch-only](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5047/) through xpubs! This feature was made possible by the [introduction of watch-only accounts to btcwallet](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet/pull/667), our internal wallet. This functionality is exposed through two new RPCs within the `WalletKit` sub-server: `ImportAccount` and `ImportPublicKey`.

**Events (deposits/spends) for imported keys or keys derived from an imported account will only be detected by lnd if they happen after the import.** Rescans to detect past events will be supported in a future release, so make sure to use a new unused wallet when using this functionality.

[A new document was added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/key_import.md) that explains the account import and PSBT signing process.

### ECDH Revocation Seed

The revocation seed is used to generate revocation secrets during the lifetime of a channel. The [seed-generation code](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4517) has been updated to no longer handle raw private keys, using ECDH to achieve this.

### Auto-unlock wallet from password file

In automated or unattended setups such as cluster/container environments, unlocking the wallet through RPC presents a series of challenges. Usually, the password is present as a file somewhere in the container already anyway so writing an extra custom script for unlocking is error prone and tedious. Instead the [new `--wallet-unlock-password-file` flag was added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5256) that can be used to read the password for an existing wallet from a file [(or device or named pipe)](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/wallet.md#auto-unlocking-a-wallet) to auto-unlock it.

### Random Coin Selection

By default `lnd`'s internal wallet uses a coin selection algorithm that always picks the largest UTXOs available first when crafting a transaction. This can lead to a wallet state that has many small and uneconomical UTXOs. To counteract that, a new [`--coin-selection-strategy`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5155) flag was added that can be set to `random` instead of the default `larges` value to enable random coin selection.

## Backend Enhancements &amp; Optimizations

### Daemon-Level Block Cache

[`lnd` now maintains a global daemon-level block cache](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5156) to prevent redundant `GetBlock` calls across all of its sub-systems. This cache can store up to 20MB worth of block data by default, and can be changed through the new config option `blockcachesize`.

### `bitcoind` Pruned Node Support

[`lnd` now supports connecting to pruned `bitcoind` backends](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5154#)! A new sub-system has been introduced that maintains connections to bitcoin peers to retrieve pruned blocks from and caches them. These peers are sourced from the peer list of the connected `bitcoind` instance, or from the `getnodeaddress` RPC otherwise. The number of connections (4 by default) can be configured through the new config option `bitcoind.pruned-node-max-peers`.

### Neutrino Optimizations

The memory footprint used throughout the initial block header sync has been [reduced by 50%](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino/pull/213).

The set of [filter header checkpoints for the mainnet and testnet chains have been updated](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino/pull/215).

### Neutrino Channel Validation

Compact filters retrieved from peers to determine whether the corresponding block contains any relevant transactions are now [validated by checking whether they were constructed correctly](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino/pull/215).

[`lnd` instances _backed by Neutrino_ now have channel validation disabled by default](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5193). Channel validation includes obtaining the block a channel was included in and verifying the channel output remains unspent. This is an intensive process for light-clients as they don't maintain a block index and UTXO set. The `routing.assumechanvalid` config option, which disables channel validation, has now been deprecated. Channel validation can be re-enabled for Neutrino-backed lnd nodes with the new config option `neutrino.validatechannels`.

### Neutrino Configuration

[`neutrino.broadcasttimeout` allows users to specify how long they wish their broadcast attempts to last before giving up](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5257).

[`neutrino.persistfilters` allows users to persist compact filters retrieved from the network](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5257). This will result in less bandwidth consumption at the expense of storage.

[`neutrino.validatechannels` can be activated to enable channel validation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5193). Note that light-clients are not well-equipped to perform this type of validation without SPV channel proofs (keep an eye out for this in future releases!).

### Immediate graph updates for local channels

In [lnd v0.12.0](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.0-beta) we saw a massive enhancement to graph sync, since batch writing of gossip messages to the database was introduced. However, this also included local updates made, which could cause these to become slightly delayed. In this release the local updates will now get special treatment, and [are added immediately](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4964).

### Clustered LND configuration with leader elected primary

So far lnd has mainly been used in single node setups with local databases. This configuration makes it challenging to build a highly available lighting service, since the node itself has to be online and users have to build ad-hoc solutions for database replication and re-deployment in case of failure or datacenter migration.
With the recent addtion of the etcd kvdb driver for lnd we've made incremental steps toward an out-of-the box HA solution.
With this release we [add experimental support for leader elected lnd cluster](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4998), where apart from the graph, all important state can reside in a replicated etcd database. This allows us to use etcd's leader election facilities to form a cluster of multiple lnd nodes, where one of them is the primary node accessing the DB, while the rest are waiting in line to become the leader if a failover happens (eg. primary is decomissioned, crash, network partition, etc). In such configuration all the nodes in the cluster share the same lightning identity but only the active leader has full control while the rest are dormant.

## RPC

### Unification of WalletUnlocker and Lightning services

This release brings a [massive overhaul to the way the wallet is unlocked](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4985) on the backend, while staying backwards compatible.

Earlier version of lnd would bring up a gRPC server that exposed the `WalletUnlocker` service, which would in turn be stopped and restarted to bring up the `Lightning` service after successful unlock. This caused issues with some clients that didn't expect the available services to change during runtime, and it also made it hard to determine the state of the wallet without string matching on the error received from calling the RPC server.

In `lnd v0.13.0`, the two gRPC services (and subserver services) are available at all times such that we avoid tearing down the gRPC server at runtime. The RPC endpoints are gated by the wallet state (see below) such that only RPCs from the `WalletUnlocker` service are available as long as the wallet remains locked.

If you relied on the RPC errors or availability of the different services to determine the wallet state, you should change to use the new `State` service.

### New `State` Service

[A new service](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5005) is now exposed on the `lnd` gRPC server: `State`. This can be used to get the state of the wallet at all times, and should be used to programatically drive the unlocking process.

The possible wallet states are `[NON_EXISTING, LOCKED, UNLOCKED, RPC_ACTIVE]` and the state can be subscribed to using the `SubscribeState` RPC, or fetched using `lncli state`.

### Mission Control

Mission Control's parameters can now [read and set](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4909/) while lnd is running using the `GetMissionControlConfig` and `SetMissionControlConfig` endpoints. This allows nodes to experiment with these parameters without restarting lnd.

An [experimental](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5061) `XImportMissionControl` API has been added to allow nodes to import state from other lnd nodes' `QueryMissionControl` output. This allows new nodes to start include routing insights that another node has learned, rather than starting with no information about the network. This imported information is not currently persisted. Note that sharing your `QueryMissionControl` output with another party may leak information about your payment history.

### Bi-directional Stream Support for REST WebSockets

[A fix to the WebSocket proxy](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5237) now allows all RPCs to be used over REST/WebSockets, including the client-streaming ones (specifically `lnrpc.Lightning.ChannelAcceptor`, `lnrpc.Lightning.SendPayment` and `routerrpc.Router.HtlcInterceptor`).

An [example for using the channel acceptor over REST](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/rest/websockets.md#request-streaming-rpcs) was added to the documentation.

### Option to delete failed payments

In earlier versions of lnd you could delete all finished payments from the database using the `DeleteAllPayments` RPC. Two new flags `failed_payments_only` and `failed_htlcs_only` have been added to this RPC, which can be used to [delete only payments (HTLCs) that failed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/3191).

### `WalletKit` &amp; Wallet-Related RPCs

[`LeaseOutput` has been extended to allow custom lease expirations and a new `ListLeases` RPC has been added to allow users to determine which outputs are currently being leased and for how long](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5095).

As part of our watch-only key import efforts, three new RPCs have been [added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5047/) to the `WalletKit` sub-server to interact with them:

* `ImportAccount` imports an BIP-0049/BIP-0084 account as watch-only through its extended public key (xpub).
* `ImportPublicKey` imports a BIP-0049/BIP-0084 public key into a default &quot;imported&quot; account.
* `ListAccounts` exposes information for accounts (watch-only or not) existing within the wallet.

Several existing RPCs were also [modified](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5047/) (in a backwards-compatible manner) to either accept an account parameter in their requests or break down their responses by accounts.

* `GetTransactions` and `ListUnspent` can now filter through transactions and outputs belonging to a specific account.
* `FundPSBT/FinalizePSBT` can now fund/finalize PSBTs from a specific account.
* `NewAddress` can now generate addresses for a specific account.
* `WalletBalance` now returns an additional breakdown of the total wallet balance by accounts.

### Longer Default Invoice Expiries

Over the past few months, we've heard from multiple sources that the default invoice expiries are too short. As a result, the default expiry for MPP invoices has been [raised from one hour to one day](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/4bb6cc9cee275e7f583039ead826d0fc6f6c4c33/lnrpc/invoicesrpc/addinvoice.go#L29).

### Surfacing `INVALID_ONION_PAYLOAD` failures

Payments that fail with [`INVALID_ONION_PAYLOAD` are now properly reported via SendToRoute and SendPaymentV2](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5074) as `lnrpc.INVALID_ONION_PAYLOAD`. Prior to 0.13 these were reported as `lnrpc.Failure_UNKNOWN_FAILURE`.

## `pprof` Security

lnd will no longer make its pprof port accessible to the world by default, and will [instead listen on localhost if a port is specified](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5063). Exposing the pprof port is still left as an option for certain use cases.

## Mobile

### Simplified API using the State service

Using the mobile bindings one would earlier need to wait for the `unlockerReady` callback to fire to unlock the wallet, and then the second callback`rpcReady` before the lnd RPCs were ready to be used. This was a bit awkward, and not very well supported with React Native.

This release moves back to a single `rpcReady` callback, which together with the new `State` service can be used to determine the state of lnd at all times.

To build lnd with these new bindings for mobile, [falafel v0.9.0](https://github.com/lightninglabs/falafel/releases/tag/v0.9.0) should be used.

### Avoid killing the app on lnd failure

Instead of killing the application in case lnd fails to start, we now [return an error back](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5086) over the API.

### Delayed Zombie Pruning

We [delay graph zombie pruning](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4933) on startup by 30 sec, to avoid blocking on this operation. This shortens the delay from unlocking to lnd is ready, which especially should improve the experience on mobile.

## Bug Fixes

* A regression in the channel state-machine that would lead to de-sync and force close has been [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5231). Channels between upgraded nodes should not experience incorrect force closes.
* The failure message used by the HTLC Interceptor to reject HTLCs has been updated to [include a channel update](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5230) with the temporary channel failure error code.
* A bug that could cause lnd to fail starting up if a new channel was in the process of being opened has [been fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4958).
* In case a channel announcment for a local channel was received after channel closure, `neutrino` backed nodes could end up re-adding the channel to the graph. This has been fixed by [ignoring all local announcements](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4899) coming from our peers.
* A bug in the payment state machine which would result in a payment getting stuck if it received a terminal payment error shortly before dispatching another shard has been [addressed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5214).
* The `SubscribeSingleInvoice` API has been [updated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5207) to terminate the stream of events once the invoice reaches a terminal state.
* During a block storm or integration tests the router subsystem can lag behind on its best known block due to the pruning work it has to complete for each block. Previously the `synced_to_chain` flag of the `GetInfo` RPC would only look at the best height of the wallet vs. its chain backend. To make sure the router is also up to date, [the flag now only turns `true` if the router subsystem is synced to the same height as the wallet](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5281)
* Some terminals don't allow more than 4096 characters to be pasted if running in interactive/TTY mode. This lead to large PSBTs being cut off during channel open. This [was fixed by allowing the PSBT to be read from a file](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5083) in addition to the terminal.
* The `GetNodeInfo` RPC has been [updated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5295) to  output the channel policies for the requested node in the expected order. Previously, its ordering was inconsistent with `DescribeGraph` and `GetChanInfo`.
* The `num_pending_backups` stat exposed by configured watchtower clients through the `WatchtowerClient` sub-server is now properly [decremented after a backup has been accepted](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5212) by a watchtower.

    <summary>## Main changes

### Remove editable fee rate in swap-out

Swap-outs (LN -&gt; on-chain) are actually spending from a shared UTXO set. To make things consistent and ensure good UX for every users, the swap-out fee rate is now defined by the swap service. 

More info here: https://phoenix.acinq.co/faq#why-dont-you-let-me-set-the-feerate-myself-when-sending-on-chain

### Added a button to enlarge the receive QR code

This will help scanning a invoice with low resolution camera.

### Added an option to disable pay-to-open

On-the-fly channel creation has a fee and users may want to disable it. In that case, if a new channel was required to be created in order for a incoming payment to be received, the payment will fail and a notification will be displayed (with a cooldown to prevent notification spam).

    <summary>This release of `btcd` is primarily to act as a catchup for the various changes that have accumulated.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already:

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt` and `manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt.sig` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt.sig
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: assuming signed data in 'manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt'
gpg: Signature made Tue 08 Jun 2021 10:07:53 AM EDT
gpg:                using DSA key 0DB39EAF526568682088EEDFB15210D35378BD54
gpg: Good signature from &quot;John C. Vernaleo &lt;john@netpurgatory.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]

```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Binaries

As of this release, our release binaries are **fully reproducible** thanks to `go1.13`! Third parties are now able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/tree/master/release) for how this can be achieved. The release binaries are compiled with `go1.16.5`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:
```
git verify-tag v0.22.0-beta
```

You should see something along the lines of this in the case of a valid tag:
```
gpg: Signature made Tue 08 Jun 2021 09:42:52 AM EDT
gpg:                using DSA key 0DB39EAF526568682088EEDFB15210D35378BD54
gpg: Good signature from &quot;John C. Vernaleo &lt;john@netpurgatory.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

# Building the Contained Release

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming that `vendor.tar.gz` and `btcd-source-v0.22.0-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf btcd-source-v0.22.0.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor ./cmd/btcctl
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory.

Additionally, it's also possible to use the enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so:

```
BTCBUILDSYS=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot; ./build/release/release.sh
```

    <link href="https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/releases/tag/v0.22.0-beta"/>
    <summary>This release of `btcd` is primarily to act as a catchup for the various changes that have accumulated.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already:

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt` and `manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt.sig` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt.sig
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: assuming signed data in 'manifest-v0.22.0-beta.txt'
gpg: Signature made Tue 08 Jun 2021 10:07:53 AM EDT
gpg:                using DSA key 0DB39EAF526568682088EEDFB15210D35378BD54
gpg: Good signature from &quot;John C. Vernaleo &lt;john@netpurgatory.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]

```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Binaries

As of this release, our release binaries are **fully reproducible** thanks to `go1.13`! Third parties are now able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/tree/master/release) for how this can be achieved. The release binaries are compiled with `go1.16.5`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:
```
git verify-tag v0.22.0-beta
```

You should see something along the lines of this in the case of a valid tag:
```
gpg: Signature made Tue 08 Jun 2021 09:42:52 AM EDT
gpg:                using DSA key 0DB39EAF526568682088EEDFB15210D35378BD54
gpg: Good signature from &quot;John C. Vernaleo &lt;john@netpurgatory.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

# Building the Contained Release

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming that `vendor.tar.gz` and `btcd-source-v0.22.0-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf btcd-source-v0.22.0.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor ./cmd/btcctl
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory.

Additionally, it's also possible to use the enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so:

```
BTCBUILDSYS=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot; ./build/release/release.sh
```

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.6.5.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.6.5-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.6.5.jar.txt file.

*NEW: There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.6.5.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 11.0.10 and the v1.6.5 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.*

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.6.5.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.
