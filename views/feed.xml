    <link href="https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/tag/v1.3.0-pre6"/>
    <summary># v1.3.0-pre6 - This is a pre-release (i.e. beta software).

# Use this with caution!!!

## Main changes to test:
- **Bitcoin Core and Tor setup**: Specter now has a new setup wizard, accessible from the main screen, which allows setting up Bitcoin Core and Tor directly from Specter. You can also setup Tor separately from the Tor settings tab. The Tor and Bitcoin Core will automatically start and stop with Specter launch/ close. (Warning: If you're already using Bitcoin Core on the machine you're testing the setup on, Specter by default will use and override existing files in the default location of Bitcoin Core - since we assume users who need Bitcoin Core installation from Specter don't have a node there already. If that is a concern for you, make sure to specify a custom path to Bitcoin Core data folder so Specter will use that instead, this can be done from the advanced section of the wizard).
- **Full RBF editing option**: You can now fully edit an RBF transaction - i.e. change recipient address, add inputs, edit amounts etc.
- **HWI v2.0.0**: New version of HWI with major changes, meaning all USB-connected hardware wallets should be tested to ensure the new version did not break any integration.
- **BitBox02 Multisig support**: With HWI v2.0.0, Specter now supports using BitBox02 in multisig setups.
- **Async wallets loading**: The process of loading existing wallets into Specter on startup has been moved to the background. Specter should now start up much faster, and you may see loading indication at first for the wallets.
- **Abandon transaction**: If you sent a transaction that has been purged from the mempool, it is now possible to make your wallet forget it so that the funds are spendable again. 
- **Mempool.space fee estimation**: The default fee estimation source is now mempool.space. It's also possible to configure in the general settings to use either Bitcoin Core, or a self-hosted instance of mempool.space.
- **Block explorer default options**: We now have default options for block explorers instead of only free text. It's still possible to use as free text by choosing `custom`.
- **HWI Bridge Redesign**: The process and design of configuring Specter used on a remote machine to allow USB connections has been simplified and redesigned.
- **More currencies and precious metals in price bar**: More currencies are now available for automated price pulling, also precious metals, with multiple weight unit options, are now available too.
- **Fix escaping of JSON wallet backup**: Avoid escaping the JSON file downloaded on wallet backup.
- **Fix Bitcoin Core v0.21 UTXO consolidation issue**: Previous version had a bug where UTXO consolidation transactions were would always show up as unconfirmed if Bitcoin Core v0.21 is used.
- **Fix Signet Nested SegWit**: Nested SegWit addresses on Signet were previously generated incorrectly.

    <link href="https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.6.0"/>
    <summary>## Release notes
This release ships the official beta release for the Bisq API! It has been tested on mainnet, but is still in beta, so please be careful.

Other highlights: absolute minimum deposits have now been lowered from 0.006 BTC to 0.001 BTC. Maker and taker fee transactions are now verified via mempool.space to reduce trade issues, and mediation and arbitration were improved as well. And as always, there are many bug fixes and refinements.

Also important: this release ships part of 1 of 2 for BSQ SegWit implementation. It prepares the network for handling SegWit BSQ transactions (activation block is 680300, around 2021/04/25 -- all full nodes should update to 1.6.0 before that time). Shortly after this activation point, the wallet code (https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5109) will be merged into master for testing so that the full BSQ SegWit update is shipped in the following release.

### Assets
No new assets.

## Verification

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.6.0.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
`shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/Java/Bisq-1.6.0.jar`
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.6.0.jar.txt file.


## Known issues with installation 

### macOS Catalina:

&gt; Bisq can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

This happens the first time Bisq is run on macOS Catalina. It is because a new security feature in Catalina has newer requirements of how apps are packaged. We are working on ways to address this (see #3402 and #4196 for details).

Workaround: Right click on the installed Bisq app &gt; Click `Open` (warning popup shown again, but with new button available) &gt; Click `Open`

&gt; Bisq would like to receive keystrokes from any application.

Discussed in issue https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373, you will see a permission request in the latest macOS version that Bisq wants to receive keystrokes from any application. Unfortunately that is an issue for all Java applications that are run on Catalina right now. We are investigating already how to solve this issue and will fix in one of our next updates.

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/Bisq/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.6.0.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

------------

Also see the v0.2.4 releases for [bwt-electrum-plugin](https://github.com/bwt-dev/bwt-electrum-plugin/releases/tag/v0.2.4), [libbwt](https://github.com/bwt-dev/libbwt/releases/tag/v0.2.4), [libbwt-nodejs](https://github.com/bwt-dev/libbwt-nodejs/releases/tag/v0.2.4) and [libbwt-jni](https://github.com/bwt-dev/libbwt-jni/releases/tag/v0.2.4).

### Installation

Installation instructions are [available on the README](https://github.com/bwt-dev/bwt#installation).

### Verifying signatures

The releases are signed by Nadav Ivgi (@shesek). The public key can be verified on the [PGP WoT](http://keys.gnupg.net/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;fingerprint=on&amp;search=0x81F6104CD0F150FC), [github](https://api.github.com/users/shesek/gpg_keys), [twitter](https://twitter.com/shesek), [keybase](https://keybase.io/nadav), [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nadaviv) and [this video presentation](https://youtu.be/SXJaN2T3M10?t=4).

```bash
# Download (change x86_64-linux to your platform)
$ wget https://github.com/bwt-dev/bwt/releases/download/v0.2.4/bwt-0.2.4-x86_64-linux.tar.gz

# Fetch public key
$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys FCF19B67866562F08A43AAD681F6104CD0F150FC

# Verify signature
$ wget -qO - https://github.com/bwt-dev/bwt/releases/download/v0.2.4/SHA256SUMS.asc \
  | gpg --decrypt - | grep ' bwt-0.2.4-x86_64-linux.tar.gz$' | sha256sum -c -

$ tar zxvf bwt-0.2.4-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
$ ./bwt-0.1.5-x86_64-linux/bwt --xpub &lt;xpub&gt; ...
```

The signature verification should show `Good signature from &quot;Nadav Ivgi &lt;nadav@shesek.info&gt;&quot; ... Primary key fingerprint: FCF1 9B67 ...` and `bwt-0.2.4-x86_64-linux.tar.gz: OK`.

### Reproducible builds

The builds are fully reproducible.

You can verify the checksums against the v0.2.4 builds on Travis CI: https://travis-ci.org/github/bwt-dev/bwt/builds/764306060

- **Full RBF editing option**: You can now fully edit an RBF transaction - i.e. change recipient address, add inputs, edit amounts etc.
- **HWI v2.0.0**: New version of HWI with major changes, meaning all USB-connected hardware wallets should be tested to ensure the new version did not break any integration.
- **BitBox02 Multisig support**: With HWI v2.0.0, Specter now supports using BitBox02 in multisig setups.

- **Abandon transaction**: If you sent a transaction that has been purged from the mempool, it is now possible to make your wallet forget it so that the funds are spendable again. 
- **Mempool.space fee estimation**: The default fee estimation source is now mempool.space. It's also possible to configure in the general settings to use either Bitcoin Core, or a self-hosted instance of mempool.space.
- **Block explorer default options**: We now have default options for block explorers instead of only free text. It's still possible to use as free text by choosing `custom`.
- **HWI Bridge Redesign**: The process and design of configuring Specter used on a remote machine to allow USB connections has been simplified and redesigned.
- **More currencies and precious metals in price bar**: More currencies are now available for automated price pulling, also precious metals, with multiple weight unit options, are now available too.
- **Fix escaping of JSON wallet backup**: Avoid escaping the JSON file downloaded on wallet backup.
- **Fix Bitcoin Core v0.21 UTXO consolidation issue**: Previous version had a bug where UTXO consolidation transactions were would always show up as unconfirmed if Bitcoin Core v0.21 is used.
- **Fix Signet Nested SegWit**: Nested SegWit addresses on Signet were previously generated incorrectly.

    <link href="https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/tag/v1.3.0-pre3"/>
    <summary># v1.3.0-pre3 - This is a pre-release (i.e. beta software).

# Use this with caution!!!

## Main changes to test:
- **Bitcoin Core and Tor setup**: Specter now has a new setup wizard, accessible from the main screen, which allows setting up Bitcoin Core and Tor directly from Specter. You can also setup Tor separately from the Tor settings tab. The Tor and Bitcoin Core will automatically start and stop with Specter launch/ close. (Warning: If you're already using Bitcoin Core on the machine you're testing the setup on, Specter by default will use and override existing files in the default location of Bitcoin Core - since we assume users who need Bitcoin Core installation from Specter don't have a node there already. If that is a concern for you, make sure to specify a custom path to Bitcoin Core data folder so Specter will use that instead, this can be done from the advanced section of the wizard).
- **Full RBF editing option**: You can now fully edit an RBF transaction - i.e. change recipient address, add inputs, edit amounts etc.
- **HWI v2.0.0**: New version of HWI with major changes, meaning all USB-connected hardware wallets should be tested to ensure the new version did not break any integration.
- **BitBox02 Multisig support**: With HWI v2.0.0, Specter now supports using BitBox02 in multisig setups.
- **Async wallets loading**: The process of loading existing wallets into Specter on startup has been moved to the background. Specter should now start up much faster, and you may see loading indication at first for the wallets.

    <link href="https://github.com/bwt-dev/bwt/releases/tag/v0.2.3"/>
    <summary>### Changelog

- New `--prune-until &lt;target&gt;` option to automatically prune the chain up to the given target (height, unix timestamp or YYYY-MM-DD formatted date)

  Require configuring bitcoind with `prune=1` to allow manual pruning via the RPC.

- New `--no-wait-sync` option to allow importing addresses without waiting for bitcoind to finish syncing first

  Useful for tracking wallets during the IBD of a pruned node, so transactions could be indexed before the blocks get pruned.

- Fix compatibility with the upcoming v0.22 Bitcoin Core release (https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/issues/67#issuecomment-791522237)

- HTTP: Set the `WWW-Authenticate` header to make logging-in possible via web browsers

- Implement an [fd-based daemon readiness notification mechanism](https://skarnet.org/software/s6/notifywhenup.html), enabled with `FD_NOTIFY=&lt;fd&gt;`

- Fix whitepaper extractor

- UX touchups for progress indicator, welcome banner and logs

- Allow setting `UNIX_LISTENER_MODE` to control permissions for the unix socket notification listener

- Allow setting `NO_REQUIRE_ADDRESSES` as an env variable

Breaking CLI changes:

- The Electrum SOCKS5-based authentication needs to be explicitly enabled with `--electrum-socks-auth`,
  in addition to enabling the `--auth-*` options. By default, authentication will only be enabled for
  the HTTP API server.

Also see the v0.2.3 releases for [bwt-electrum-plugin](https://github.com/bwt-dev/bwt-electrum-plugin/releases/tag/v0.2.3), [libbwt](https://github.com/bwt-dev/libbwt/releases/tag/v0.2.3), [libbwt-nodejs](https://github.com/bwt-dev/libbwt-nodejs/releases/tag/v0.2.3) and [libbwt-jni](https://github.com/bwt-dev/libbwt-jni/releases/tag/v0.2.3).

### Installation

Installation instructions are [available on the README](https://github.com/bwt-dev/bwt#installation).

### Verifying signatures

The releases are signed by Nadav Ivgi (@shesek). The public key can be verified on the [PGP WoT](http://keys.gnupg.net/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;fingerprint=on&amp;search=0x81F6104CD0F150FC), [github](https://api.github.com/users/shesek/gpg_keys), [twitter](https://twitter.com/shesek), [keybase](https://keybase.io/nadav), [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nadaviv) and [this video presentation](https://youtu.be/SXJaN2T3M10?t=4).

```bash
# Download (change x86_64-linux to your platform)
$ wget https://github.com/bwt-dev/bwt/releases/download/v0.2.3/bwt-0.2.3-x86_64-linux.tar.gz

# Fetch public key
$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys FCF19B67866562F08A43AAD681F6104CD0F150FC

# Verify signature

    <summary># Summary

The recent macOS update broke the initialization of the build-in Tor client in Wasabi. As a result, the client was not able to start Tor client, thus it was not able to connect to our Backend. 

- **Tor fix on the newest macOS.** 
- **Update HWI to 2.0.0**
- **Add Ledger Nano X support**

# Newbie Guide

While setting up Wasabi is straightforward, even a Linux wizard with the longest beard can get stuck on the most basic tasks. Consider taking a look at the [Installation Instructions](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/InstallPackage.html) guide.

# Advanced Guide

If you want to build Wasabi from source code or update the source code check out [these instructions.](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/BuildSource.html)

From version 1.1.3 Wasabi also introduces [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/): [Deterministic Build Guide](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/Guides/DeterministicBuildGuide.md)

Build with .NET Core 3.1.407-win-x64.

    <summary>Also available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/hwi/) and can be installed with `pip install -U hwi`

## Added
* BitBox02 multisig signing.
* Documentation automatically generated with sphinx and hosted on https://hwi.readthedocs.io.
* Support for Python 3.9.
* Trezor allows transactions with OP_RETURN outputs.
* Full type annotations within `hwilib` and type checking.
* Updated documentation for Bitcoin Core descriptor wallets.
* Device support policy
* Enforce that the Ledger is in either the Bitcoin or Bitcoin Testnet apps.

## Changed
* `--sh_wpkh` and `--wpkh` options have been replaced with `--addr-type` with the options `legacy`, `sh_wit`, and `wit`.
* `--testnet` option replaced with `--chain` with the options `main`, `test`, `signet`, and `regtest`.
* Overhauled descriptors implementation to be similar to Bitcoin Core's descriptors implementation.
* Replaced `HardwareWalletClient.display_address` with `display_singlesig_address` and `display_multisig_address`.
* Overhauled `HardwareWalletClient` functions to return the correct objects rather than string dictionaries.
* Raise errors and exceptions instead of returning string dictionary containing error.
* `bech32.py`, `base58.py`, `cli.py`, and `gui.py` are made internal modules.
* `serializations.py` is split into `tx.py`, `psbt.py` with some functions made internal with `_script.py` and `_serialize.py`.
* `getmasterxpub` takes options for chain type, address type, and BIP 44 account in order to provide the master xpub accordingly.

## Removed
* Removed option to provide redeem script to `displayaddress`.

## Fixed
* Fixed Ledger change path detection.
* Fixed Ledger message signing when the signature is shorter than expected.
* Fixed Trezor One pin sending when a passphrase is expected.
* Fixed handling of `sortedmulti()` descriptors. Some devices which only supported key sorting will be no longer allow `multi()` descriptors. The multisigs that devices use when given a `sortedmulti()` descriptor will now match what Bitcoin Core derives for those descriptors.
* Several fixes to device enumeration.
* `installudevrules` will search for the correct binaries in the PATH rather than assuming their locations.</summary>

### Improve LNURL error feedback

Errors returned by LNURL services were not properly handled and information was lost, causing confusion, especially for LNURL-withdraw.

### Notify user when channel opening is rejected

If a new channel must be created to receive an incoming payment but the amount is below the channel creation threshold, a notification is displayed. Note that this is not enabled yet because changes on the peer side are also needed.

-- edit: this is now enabled.

### Assets
No new assets.

## Verification

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.5.9.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
`shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/Java/Bisq-1.5.9.jar`
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.5.9.jar.txt file.


## Known issues with installation 

### macOS Catalina:

&gt; Bisq can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

This happens the first time Bisq is run on macOS Catalina. It is because a new security feature in Catalina has newer requirements of how apps are packaged. We are working on ways to address this (see #3402 and #4196 for details).

Workaround: Right click on the installed Bisq app &gt; Click `Open` (warning popup shown again, but with new button available) &gt; Click `Open`

&gt; Bisq would like to receive keystrokes from any application.

Discussed in issue https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373, you will see a permission request in the latest macOS version that Bisq wants to receive keystrokes from any application. Unfortunately that is an issue for all Java applications that are run on Catalina right now. We are investigating already how to solve this issue and will fix in one of our next updates.

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/Bisq/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.5.9.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/releases/tag/v0.5.1"/>
    <summary>This release includes many bug fixes and improvements, a new API and monitoring updates.
It is fully compatible with 0.5.0 (and all previous versions of eclair).

# Major changes

### Improved startup performance

When eclair starts up and restores channels, it makes a lot of calls to `bitcoind` to check the status of each channel.
We improved our calling pattern to greatly reduce the number of calls made when some channels are closing.
This is particularly noticeable when the mempool is quite full and you have many channels.

See #1699 for details.

### Gossip sync improvements

Most of the bandwidth consumed by lightning nodes is due to gossip (syncing the network graph).
When your eclair node has a lot of peers and doesn't use a `sync-whitelist`, you may end up syncing with many different peers and obtaining redundant information, thus wasting bandwidth.
Eclair now only syncs with peers you have a channel with to reduce bandwidth usage.

### Anchor outputs

This release contains a lot of changes for the upcoming anchor outputs commitment format:

- the feerate of the commitment transaction is kept low to improve off-chain channel usage
- transactions with multiple inputs and outputs are now supported
- CPFP and RBF utilities have been added to increase the feerate of commitment and htlc transactions

While you can start experimenting with this commitment format, it is still not safe to activate in production.
Anchor outputs is a complex and subtle change that requires re-architecting most of our transaction broadcasting logic and utxo management.
We are making steady progress towards that, but we're not there yet.

### Monitoring changes

Kamon tracing has been removed in this release.
It was too invasive in the codebase, generally unused and was costing some bandwidth.
We've found that metrics and logs are enough to correctly monitor your eclair node.

Additional metrics to monitor transaction signing have been added.
The rate of transaction signatures is a good indicator of how busy your node is.

### API changes

This release adds a new path-finding API:

- `findroutebetweennodes` lets you inspect the network graph by looking for routes between two nodes (whereas `findroute` only allowed finding routes between your node and a remote node)

Head over to our [API documentation](https://acinq.github.io/eclair) for more details.

### Miscellaneous improvements and bug fixes

- Correctly sort addresses in its `node_announcement` (#1693)
- Allow 2016 blocks before unconfirmed channels are forgotten (#1692)
- Re-emit private channel updates more frequently, improving payments to mobile wallets (#1671)
- Correctly handle channel failures in private routing hints, fixing an edge case for payments to mobile wallets (#1675)
- Drop support for `initial_routing_sync`: this was bandwidth-heavy and now unnecessary (#1683)
- Fix an MPP-send edge-case (#1685)
- Fix race condition between outgoing payment and peer disconnection (#1688)
- Fix race condition between `update_fee` and `shutdown`, which could lead to channels stuck in `shutdown` (#1661)
- Ensure transactions we publish always meet bitcoin's `min_relay_fee` (#1687)
- Fix an edge case where an HTLC failure was not correctly relayed upstream if `revoke_and_ack` had not been received (#1706)

# Verifying signatures

You will need `gpg` and our release signing key 7A73FE77DE2C4027. Note that you can get it:

- from our website: https://acinq.co/pgp/drouinf.asc
- from github user @sstone, a committer on eclair: https://api.github.com/users/sstone/gpg_keys

To import our signing key:

```sh
$ gpg --import drouinf.asc
```

To verify the release file checksums and signatures:

```sh
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped
```

# Building

Eclair builds are deterministic. To reproduce our builds, please use the following environment (*):

- Ubuntu 19.10
- AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.6
- Maven 3.6.3

Use the following command to generate the eclair-node package:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

That should generate `eclair-node/target/eclair-node-0.5.1-XXXXXXX-bin.zip` with sha256 checksums that match the one we provide and sign in `SHA256SUMS.asc`

(*) You may be able to build the exact same artefacts with other operating systems or versions of JDK 11, we have not tried everything.

# Upgrading

This release is fully compatible with Eclair v0.5.0. You don't need to close your channels, just stop eclair, upgrade and restart.

### Assets
No new assets.

## Verification

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.5.8.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
`shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/Java/Bisq-1.5.8.jar`
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.5.8.jar.txt file.


## Known issues with installation 

### macOS Catalina:

&gt; Bisq can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

This happens the first time Bisq is run on macOS Catalina. It is because a new security feature in Catalina has newer requirements of how apps are packaged. We are working on ways to address this (see #3402 and #4196 for details).

Workaround: Right click on the installed Bisq app &gt; Click `Open` (warning popup shown again, but with new button available) &gt; Click `Open`

&gt; Bisq would like to receive keystrokes from any application.

Discussed in issue https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373, you will see a permission request in the latest macOS version that Bisq wants to receive keystrokes from any application. Unfortunately that is an issue for all Java applications that are run on Catalina right now. We are investigating already how to solve this issue and will fix in one of our next updates.

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/Bisq/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.5.8.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <summary># Database Migrations

There are no database migrations in `v0.12.1-beta`.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.12.1-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.sig manifest-v0.12.1-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Mon Feb 22 19:23:11 2021 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 9C8D61868A7C492003B2744EE7D737B67FA592C7
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Conner Fromknecht &lt;conner@lightning.engineering&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.sig.ots 
ots verify manifest-v0.12.1-beta.txt.ots
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.15.7`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, and `watchtowerrpc`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.12.1-beta
gpg: Signature made Mon Feb 22 17:11:56 2021 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 9C8D61868A7C492003B2744EE7D737B67FA592C7
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Conner Fromknecht &lt;conner@lightning.engineering&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.1-beta /verify-install.sh v0.12.1-beta
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.12.1-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.12.1-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.1-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.1-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

# Release Notes

## Spec Compatibility

 - 0.12.1-beta fixes a [recently discovered edge-case in the spec](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/issues/794) surrounding retransmission of `RevokeAndAck` and `CommitSig` that can lead to channel force closures if they are not retransmitted in the same order upon reconnection. This version now [persists this extra state required to determine the correct transmission order](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4915), [in accordance with the new spec requirements](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/810). This eliminates a potential vector for channel desynchronization on restart once both sides of the channel have updated and a successful state transition is performed.
 - Prior to this version, `lnd` may have incorrectly attempted an MPP payment even if the receiver's `NodeAnnouncement` or invoice did not set the MPP feature bit. This was caused by a bug that incorrectly assumed support for `payment_secrets` implied support for MPP. A fix has been applied that [limits the maximum number of splits to 1 when the receiver doesn't support MPP](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4924).

## Gossip Propagation Improvements

This release [reverts the removal of the premature channel update cache](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5003) that was removed in 0.12.0-beta. Absence of the cache was seen to cause issues with channel update propagation, so the change is reverted to restore the pre-0.12.0-beta behavior and stability. The current plan is to reschedule the cache's removal for 0.13 after performing more extensive investigation.
 
In addition, the gossip throttling adding in v0.12.0 has been [refactored to be less aggressive with respect to non-keepalive channel updates](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5006), i.e. channel updates that differ in more than just the timestamp. Previously `lnd` would drop all but the first such update that it received over the course of a block, which has reportedly been too restrictive and resulted in degraded propagation of routine channel updates.

The new throttling logic now employs a directional [token bucket rate limiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket), the same approach used by `lnd` to rate-limit gossip requests from sync peers. Each token bucket is configured to drop non-keepalive updates arriving faster that once per minute, yet permitting bursts of up 10 updates. This improves on the previous approach in a few ways:
 - Updates are now limited with respect to a consistent time source, i.e. seconds, rather than block height. This makes it easier to reason about when channel updates might get dropped as an average user, and places a deterministic bound on the next time a normal user can reliably update their channel again.
 - The rate limits are now applied _directionally_, so that one end of the channel cannot cause their counterparty's channel updates to be dropped. This has the effect of making the penalization more precise, and better targets individuals that exhibit abusive behavior.
 - By factoring in bursts, it provides enough tolerance for cases where policy changes that may occur in quick succession, e.g. disable followed by reenable, or modifying a channel policy immediately after open.

## No Gossip Mode

This release includes support for a [no-graph sync mode](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4945) which can be enabled by setting `numgraphsyncpeers=0`. In prior versions, running `lnd` in this configuration would still trigger an initial historical sync with the first connected peer on each restart. The behavior was modified under the assumption that users who have already configured `lnd` to not receive gossip updates probably don't want to sync the graph at all.

This mode is especially helpful to wallet developers that choose to outsource pathfinding via their own service, or purely forwarding nodes that never need to perform pathfinding.

## Pinned Gossip Syncers

Typically `lnd` performs this historical channel reconciliation periodically, rotating between the set of all active peers, and attempting to keep `numgraphsyncpeers` (defaults to 3) in a state where they are receiving new gossip messages. Due to the eventually consistent properties of this algorithm (and the gossip protocol in general), there are some cases that lead to long delays in a node receiving newer updates. Notably, if a node has many peers, then it may be a while before the sync rotation algorithm queries a given peer for newer updates.

To provide more control, a new configuration option has been added [allowing users to _pin_ their nodes into an ActiveSync with particular nodes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4934). Each time a connection is established with a pinned syncer, `lnd` will first perform a historical channel reconciliation, followed by a request for the pinned syncer to forward all new gossip messages. Doing so allows users to keep their routing table tightly synchronized with nodes in their list of configured, pinned syncers. Users can add one or more pinned syncers via:
```
gossip.pinned-syncers=&lt;pubkey1&gt;
gossip.pinned-syncers=&lt;pubkey2&gt;
```
This can be especially useful for services that run multiple, well-connected `lnd` nodes, and want their own nodes to maintain similar views of the channel graph. Users can also use `gossip.pinned-syncers` in combination with `numgraphsyncpeers=0` to only sync from a specific peer.

## RPC Changes
 - `lnd` 0.12.1-beta now [exposes the HTLC `attempt_id` on response from `TrackPayment`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4956). Internally, `lnd` uses `attempt_id` as a unique identifier for each HTLC it sends out, and to provide a total ordering on all HTLC sent by the daemon.  This identifier can be used by developers to better reflect progress of a payment, making it easier to extract per-HTLC state deltas rather than displaying the full payment state every time.
- Adds a new `MaxShardSizeMsat` argument to `SendPayment`, allowing users to cap the maximum value of any MPP shard sent out by `lnd`. Users can now set this from `lncli` via either the `max_shard_size_sat` or `max_shard_size_msat` field. 


## Deterministic Build / Release Verification
 - The signature verification script [was fixed to no longer fail if a public key of a signature is missing](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4963) and @halseth's [signing public keys were added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4962).
 - The [golang version `1.15.7`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4961) is now used for compilation across all build processes.
 - The release process has been modified to [clean any generated mobile stubs before packaging/verifying the release](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4983). Without doing so, users would arrive at a different `vendor.tar.gz` depending on whether or not they had previously run `make mobile` due to small differences in the imports present in the project.
 - Fixed an issue that allowed GO_VERSION of the release toolchain to be spuriously updated to newer releases of go. This was hit unexpectedly in the v0.12.1-beta.rc2 release cycle where the release binaries were built with go1.15.8, which had been released earlier in the week, rather than go1.15.7 which is pinned in our release/verify docker containers. As a result, building the release locally did not match the binaries uploaded by github to the release. We resolved this by _exactly_ [pinning the GO_VERSION used to compile the release binaries](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5013).
 - Allows users to [pass custom paths for `lnd` or `lncli` when verifying binaries](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5021).
 - Switches the [signing on the release manfest to use detached signatures](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5019) rather than clear signing the manifest.
 - The release [verification script now requires 5 of the 7 developer signatures on the manifest](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5023) before attempting to verify the hashes of `lnd` or `lncli`.
 - The release [verification script now selects either `sha256sum` or `shasum`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5037) to increase portability and fix the docker `verify-install.sh` command.
 - Fixed an issue that would cause[ `make docker-release` to pull in the go version of the host machine](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5037), rather than the go version pinned inside the docker container.

## Developer Toolchain
 - Some of the GitHub Action scripts [were replaced by vendored scripts](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4952) to prevent secret extraction through malicious code.
 - The build process was [enhanced with a `make imports`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2162) command that organizes all golang import statements.
 - The protobuf definitions are now compiled [using docker](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4911) to avoid needing to install a set of binaries and libraries with exact pinned versions. The instructions on how to [format the proto files with MacOS](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4944) were added as well.

## Bug Fixes
 - Fixes a bug that can result in a [panic when generating hodl invoices for private channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4978). An [itest has also been added for generating hodl invoices using private channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4996) to provide more complete coverage of this area going forward.
 - Fixes a [resource utilization issue cause by too many concurrent block fetches from the backend](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5043) that would cause the rpc interface to hang.
 - Squashes a bug that results in a [startup error when the daemon exits while in the middle of processing graph updates for its own channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4958).
 - Creates a [fast-path for persisting locally-created gossip messages](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4964) rather than waiting to be batched with remote graph updates. This reduces the likelihood of partially-writes for local graph updates, which was partially patched in https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4958.
 - The development docker files were [fixed by adding an extra listener](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4938) to make sure the beginner tutorial can be followed without running into errors.
 - Fixes an [error message returned when attempting to bind a REST listener on a public interface without authentication](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4993), such that it returns the relevant configuration flag (`no-rest-tls`).
 - Fixes an issue with [IPv6 address resolution when using `tor.active`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4988) such that `lnd` will fall back to the system resolver.
 - Fixes an issue with [IP alias resolution](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5007) such that `lnd` will fall back to the system resolver.
 - Fixes a bug where [SCB file paths weren't properly expanded when in the home directory](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5020).
 - Fixes some itest flakes caused by [stray logs that were not in the error whitelist](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5016).
 - Resolves some [htlcswitch unit test flakes that would trigger if the test ran longer than expected](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5026).

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.1-beta.rc6"/>
    <summary># Database Migrations

There are no database migrations in `v0.12.1-beta.rc6`.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc6.sig` and `manifest-v0.12.1-beta.rc6.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc6.sig manifest-v0.12.1-beta.rc6.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Thu Feb 18 18:01:34 2021 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 9C8D61868A7C492003B2744EE7D737B67FA592C7
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Conner Fromknecht &lt;conner@lightning.engineering&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc6.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc6.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc6.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.15.7`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, and `watchtowerrpc`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.12.1-beta.rc6
gpg: Signature made Thu Feb 18 17:04:03 2021 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 9C8D61868A7C492003B2744EE7D737B67FA592C7
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Conner Fromknecht &lt;conner@lightning.engineering&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker pull lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.1-beta.rc6
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.1-beta.rc6 /verify-install.sh
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.12.1-beta.rc6.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.12.1-beta.rc6.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.1-beta.rc6&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.1-beta.rc6&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

# Release Notes

## Spec Compatibility

 - 0.12.1-beta.rc6 fixes a [recently discovered edge-case in the spec](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/issues/794) surrounding retransmission of `RevokeAndAck` and `CommitSig` that can lead to channel force closures if they are not retransmitted in the same order upon reconnection. This version now [persists this extra state required to determine the correct transmission order](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4915), [in accordance with the new spec requirements](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/810). This eliminates a potential vector for channel desynchronization on restart once both sides of the channel have updated and a successful state transition is performed.
 - Prior to this version, `lnd` may have incorrectly attempted an MPP payment even if the receiver's `NodeAnnouncement` or invoice did not set the MPP feature bit. This was caused by a bug that incorrectly assumed support for `payment_secrets` implied support for MPP. A fix has been applied that [limits the maximum number of splits to 1 when the receiver doesn't support MPP](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4924).

## Gossip Propagation Improvements

This release [reverts the removal of the premature channel update cache](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5003) that was removed in 0.12.0-beta. Absence of the cache was seen to cause issues with channel update propagation, so the change is reverted to restore the pre-0.12.0-beta behavior and stability. The current plan is to reschedule the cache's removal for 0.13 after performing more extensive investigation.
 
In addition, the gossip throttling adding in v0.12.0 has been [refactored to be less aggressive with respect to non-keepalive channel updates](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5006), i.e. channel updates that differ in more than just the timestamp. Previously `lnd` would drop all but the first such update that it received over the course of a block, which has reportedly been too restrictive and resulted in degraded propagation of routine channel updates.

The new throttling logic now employs a directional [token bucket rate limiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket), the same approach used by `lnd` to rate-limit gossip requests from sync peers. Each token bucket is configured to drop non-keepalive updates arriving faster that once per minute, yet permitting bursts of up 10 updates. This improves on the previous approach in a few ways:
 - Updates are now limited with respect to a consistent time source, i.e. seconds, rather than block height. This makes it easier to reason about when channel updates might get dropped as an average user, and places a deterministic bound on the next time a normal user can reliably update their channel again.
 - The rate limits are now applied _directionally_, so that one end of the channel cannot cause their counterparty's channel updates to be dropped. This has the effect of making the penalization more precise, and better targets individuals that exhibit abusive behavior.
 - By factoring in bursts, it provides enough tolerance for cases where policy changes that may occur in quick succession, e.g. disable followed by reenable, or modifying a channel policy immediately after open.

## No Gossip Mode

This release includes support for a [no-graph sync mode](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4945) which can be enabled by setting `numgraphsyncpeers=0`. In prior versions, running `lnd` in this configuration would still trigger an initial historical sync with the first connected peer on each restart. The behavior was modified under the assumption that users who have already configured `lnd` to not receive gossip updates probably don't want to sync the graph at all.

This mode is especially helpful to wallet developers that choose to outsource pathfinding via their own service, or purely forwarding nodes that never need to perform pathfinding.

## Pinned Gossip Syncers

Typically `lnd` performs this historical channel reconciliation periodically, rotating between the set of all active peers, and attempting to keep `numgraphsyncpeers` (defaults to 3) in a state where they are receiving new gossip messages. Due to the eventually consistent properties of this algorithm (and the gossip protocol in general), there are some cases that lead to long delays in a node receiving newer updates. Notably, if a node has many peers, then it may be a while before the sync rotation algorithm queries a given peer for newer updates.

To provide more control, a new configuration option has been added [allowing users to _pin_ their nodes into an ActiveSync with particular nodes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4934). Each time a connection is established with a pinned syncer, `lnd` will first perform a historical channel reconciliation, followed by a request for the pinned syncer to forward all new gossip messages. Doing so allows users to keep their routing table tightly synchronized with nodes in their list of configured, pinned syncers. Users can add one or more pinned syncers via:
```
gossip.pinned-syncers=&lt;pubkey1&gt;
gossip.pinned-syncers=&lt;pubkey2&gt;
```
This can be especially useful for services that run multiple, well-connected `lnd` nodes, and want their own nodes to maintain similar views of the channel graph. Users can also use `gossip.pinned-syncers` in combination with `numgraphsyncpeers=0` to only sync from a specific peer.

## RPC Changes
 - `lnd` 0.12.1-beta.rc6 now [exposes the HTLC `attempt_id` on response from `TrackPayment`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4956). Internally, `lnd` uses `attempt_id` as a unique identifier for each HTLC it sends out, and to provide a total ordering on all HTLC sent by the daemon.  This identifier can be used by developers to better reflect progress of a payment, making it easier to extract per-HTLC state deltas rather than displaying the full payment state every time.
- Adds a new `MaxShardSizeMsat` argument to `SendPayment`, allowing users to cap the maximum value of any MPP shard sent out by `lnd`. Users can now set this from `lncli` via either the `max_shard_size_sat` or `max_shard_size_msat` field. 


## Deterministic Build / Release Verification
 - The signature verification script [was fixed to no longer fail if a public key of a signature is missing](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4963) and @halseth's [signing public keys were added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4962).
 - The [golang version `1.15.7`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4961) is now used for compilation across all build processes.
 - The release process has been modified to [clean any generated mobile stubs before packaging/verifying the release](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4983). Without doing so, users would arrive at a different `vendor.tar.gz` depending on whether or not they had previously run `make mobile` due to small differences in the imports present in the project.
 - Fixed an issue that allowed GO_VERSION of the release toolchain to be spuriously updated to newer releases of go. This was hit unexpectedly in the v0.12.1-beta.rc2 release cycle where the release binaries were built with go1.15.8, which had been released earlier in the week, rather than go1.15.7 which is pinned in our release/verify docker containers. As a result, building the release locally did not match the binaries uploaded by github to the release. We resolved this by _exactly_ [pinning the GO_VERSION used to compile the release binaries](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5013).
 - Allows users to [pass custom paths for `lnd` or `lncli` when verifying binaries](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5021).
 - Switches the [signing on the release manfest to use detached signatures](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5019) rather than clear signing the manifest.
 - The release [verification script now requires 5 of the 7 developer signatures on the manifest](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5023) before attempting to verify the hashes of `lnd` or `lncli`.
 - The release [verification script now selects either `sha256sum` or `shasum`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5037) to increase portability and fix the docker `verify-install.sh` command.
 - Fixed an issue that would cause[ `make docker-release` to pull in the go version of the host machine](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5037), rather than the go version pinned inside the docker container.

## Developer Toolchain
 - Some of the GitHub Action scripts [were replaced by vendored scripts](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4952) to prevent secret extraction through malicious code.
 - The build process was [enhanced with a `make imports`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2162) command that organizes all golang import statements.
 - The protobuf definitions are now compiled [using docker](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4911) to avoid needing to install a set of binaries and libraries with exact pinned versions. The instructions on how to [format the proto files with MacOS](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4944) were added as well.

## Bug Fixes
 - Fixes a bug that can result in a [panic when generating hodl invoices for private channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4978). An [itest has also been added for generating hodl invoices using private channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4996) to provide more complete coverage of this area going forward.
 - Fixes a [resource utilization issue cause by too many concurrent block fetches from the backend](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5043) that would cause the rpc interface to hang.
 - Squashes a bug that results in a [startup error when the daemon exits while in the middle of processing graph updates for its own channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4958).
 - Creates a [fast-path for persisting locally-created gossip messages](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4964) rather than waiting to be batched with remote graph updates. This reduces the likelihood of partially-writes for local graph updates, which was partially patched in https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4958.
 - The development docker files were [fixed by adding an extra listener](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4938) to make sure the beginner tutorial can be followed without running into errors.
 - Fixes an [error message returned when attempting to bind a REST listener on a public interface without authentication](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4993), such that it returns the relevant configuration flag (`no-rest-tls`).
 - Fixes an issue with [IPv6 address resolution when using `tor.active`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4988) such that `lnd` will fall back to the system resolver.
 - Fixes an issue with [IP alias resolution](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5007) such that `lnd` will fall back to the system resolver.
 - Fixes a bug where [SCB file paths weren't properly expanded when in the home directory](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5020).
 - Fixes some itest flakes caused by [stray logs that were not in the error whitelist](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5016).
 - Resolves some [htlcswitch unit test flakes that would trigger if the test ran longer than expected](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5026).

    <summary># Database Migrations

There are no database migrations in `v0.12.1-beta.rc5`.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-bitconner-v0.12.1-beta.rc5.sig` and `manifest-v0.12.1-beta.rc5.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-bitconner-v0.12.1-beta.rc5.sig manifest-v0.12.1-beta.rc5.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Wed Feb 17 14:16:06 2021 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 9C8D61868A7C492003B2744EE7D737B67FA592C7
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Conner Fromknecht &lt;conner@lightning.engineering&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc5.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc5.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc5.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.15.7`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, and `watchtowerrpc`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.12.1-beta.rc5
gpg: Signature made Wed Feb 17 12:59:15 2021 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 9C8D61868A7C492003B2744EE7D737B67FA592C7
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Conner Fromknecht &lt;conner@lightning.engineering&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker pull lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.1-beta.rc5
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.1-beta.rc5 /verify-install.sh
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.12.1-beta.rc5.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.12.1-beta.rc5.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.1-beta.rc5&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.1-beta.rc5&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

# Release Notes

## Spec Compatibility

 - 0.12.1-beta.rc5 fixes a [recently discovered edge-case in the spec](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/issues/794) surrounding retransmission of `RevokeAndAck` and `CommitSig` that can lead to channel force closures if they are not retransmitted in the same order upon reconnection. This version now [persists this extra state required to determine the correct transmission order](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4915), [in accordance with the new spec requirements](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/810). This eliminates a potential vector for channel desynchronization on restart once both sides of the channel have updated and a successful state transition is performed.
 - Prior to this version, `lnd` may have incorrectly attempted an MPP payment even if the receiver's `NodeAnnouncement` or invoice did not set the MPP feature bit. This was caused by a bug that incorrectly assumed support for `payment_secrets` implied support for MPP. A fix has been applied that [limits the maximum number of splits to 1 when the receiver doesn't support MPP](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4924).

## Gossip Propagation Improvements

This release [reverts the removal of the premature channel update cache](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5003) that was removed in 0.12.0-beta. Absence of the cache was seen to cause issues with channel update propagation, so the change is reverted to restore the pre-0.12.0-beta behavior and stability. The current plan is to reschedule the cache's removal for 0.13 after performing more extensive investigation.
 
In addition, the gossip throttling adding in v0.12.0 has been [refactored to be less aggressive with respect to non-keepalive channel updates](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5006), i.e. channel updates that differ in more than just the timestamp. Previously `lnd` would drop all but the first such update that it received over the course of a block, which has reportedly been too restrictive and resulted in degraded propagation of routine channel updates.

The new throttling logic now employs a directional [token bucket rate limiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket), the same approach used by `lnd` to rate-limit gossip requests from sync peers. Each token bucket is configured to drop non-keepalive updates arriving faster that once per minute, yet permitting bursts of up 10 updates. This improves on the previous approach in a few ways:
 - Updates are now limited with respect to a consistent time source, i.e. seconds, rather than block height. This makes it easier to reason about when channel updates might get dropped as an average user, and places a deterministic bound on the next time a normal user can reliably update their channel again.
 - The rate limits are now applied _directionally_, so that one end of the channel cannot cause their counterparty's channel updates to be dropped. This has the effect of making the penalization more precise, and better targets individuals that exhibit abusive behavior.
 - By factoring in bursts, it provides enough tolerance for cases where policy changes that may occur in quick succession, e.g. disable followed by reenable, or modifying a channel policy immediately after open.

## No Gossip Mode

This release includes support for a [no-graph sync mode](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4945) which can be enabled by setting `numgraphsyncpeers=0`. In prior versions, running `lnd` in this configuration would still trigger an initial historical sync with the first connected peer on each restart. The behavior was modified under the assumption that users who have already configured `lnd` to not receive gossip updates probably don't want to sync the graph at all.

This mode is especially helpful to wallet developers that choose to outsource pathfinding via their own service, or purely forwarding nodes that never need to perform pathfinding.

## Pinned Gossip Syncers

Typically `lnd` performs this historical channel reconciliation periodically, rotating between the set of all active peers, and attempting to keep `numgraphsyncpeers` (defaults to 3) in a state where they are receiving new gossip messages. Due to the eventually consistent properties of this algorithm (and the gossip protocol in general), there are some cases that lead to long delays in a node receiving newer updates. Notably, if a node has many peers, then it may be a while before the sync rotation algorithm queries a given peer for newer updates.

To provide more control, a new configuration option has been added [allowing users to _pin_ their nodes into an ActiveSync with particular nodes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4934). Each time a connection is established with a pinned syncer, `lnd` will first perform a historical channel reconciliation, followed by a request for the pinned syncer to forward all new gossip messages. Doing so allows users to keep their routing table tightly synchronized with nodes in their list of configured, pinned syncers. Users can add one or more pinned syncers via:
```
gossip.pinned-syncers=&lt;pubkey1&gt;
gossip.pinned-syncers=&lt;pubkey2&gt;
```
This can be especially useful for services that run multiple, well-connected `lnd` nodes, and want their own nodes to maintain similar views of the channel graph. Users can also use `gossip.pinned-syncers` in combination with `numgraphsyncpeers=0` to only sync from a specific peer.

## RPC Changes
 - `lnd` 0.12.1-beta.rc5 now [exposes the HTLC `attempt_id` on response from `TrackPayment`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4956). Internally, `lnd` uses `attempt_id` as a unique identifier for each HTLC it sends out, and to provide a total ordering on all HTLC sent by the daemon.  This identifier can be used by developers to better reflect progress of a payment, making it easier to extract per-HTLC state deltas rather than displaying the full payment state every time.
- Adds a new `MaxShardSizeMsat` argument to `SendPayment`, allowing users to cap the maximum value of any MPP shard sent out by `lnd`. Users can now set this from `lncli` via either the `max_shard_size_sat` or `max_shard_size_msat` field. 


## Deterministic Build / Release Verification
 - The signature verification script [was fixed to no longer fail if a public key of a signature is missing](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4963) and @halseth's [signing public keys were added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4962).
 - The [golang version `1.15.7`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4961) is now used for compilation across all build processes.
 - The release process has been modified to [clean any generated mobile stubs before packaging/verifying the release](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4983). Without doing so, users would arrive at a different `vendor.tar.gz` depending on whether or not they had previously run `make mobile` due to small differences in the imports present in the project.
 - Fixed an issue that allowed GO_VERSION of the release toolchain to be spuriously updated to newer releases of go. This was hit unexpectedly in the v0.12.1-beta.rc2 release cycle where the release binaries were built with go1.15.8, which had been released earlier in the week, rather than go1.15.7 which is pinned in our release/verify docker containers. As a result, building the release locally did not match the binaries uploaded by github to the release. We resolved this by _exactly_ [pinning the GO_VERSION used to compile the release binaries](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5013).
 - Allows users to [pass custom paths for `lnd` or `lncli` when verifying binaries](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5021).
 - Switches the [signing on the release manfest to use detached signatures](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5019) rather than clear signing the manifest.
 - The release [verification script now requires 5 of the 7 developer signatures on the manifest](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5023) before attempting to verify the hashes of `lnd` or `lncli`.
 - The release [verification script now selects either `sha256sum` or `shasum`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5037) to increase portability and fix the `docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.1-beta.rc5 /verify-install.sh` command.
 - Fixed an issue that would cause[ `make docker-release` to pull in the go version of the host machine](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5037), rather than the go version pinned inside the docker container.

## Developer Toolchain
 - Some of the GitHub Action scripts [were replaced by vendored scripts](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4952) to prevent secret extraction through malicious code.
 - The build process was [enhanced with a `make imports`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2162) command that organizes all golang import statements.
 - The protobuf definitions are now compiled [using docker](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4911) to avoid needing to install a set of binaries and libraries with exact pinned versions. The instructions on how to [format the proto files with MacOS](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4944) were added as well.

## Bug Fixes
 - Fixes a bug that can result in a [panic when generating hodl invoices for private channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4978). An [itest has also been added for generating hodl invoices using private channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4996) to provide more complete coverage of this area going forward.
 - Squashes a bug that results in a [startup error when the daemon exits while in the middle of processing graph updates for its own channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4958).
 - Creates a [fast-path for persisting locally-created gossip messages](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4964) rather than waiting to be batched with remote graph updates. This reduces the likelihood of partially-writes for local graph updates, which was partially patched in https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4958.
 - The development docker files were [fixed by adding an extra listener](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4938) to make sure the beginner tutorial can be followed without running into errors.
 - Fixes an [error message returned when attempting to bind a REST listener on a public interface without authentication](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4993), such that it returns the relevant configuration flag (`no-rest-tls`).
 - Fixes an issue with [IPv6 address resolution when using `tor.active`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4988) such that `lnd` will fall back to the system resolver.
 - Fixes an issue with [IP alias resolution](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5007) such that `lnd` will fall back to the system resolver.
 - Fixes a bug where [SCB file paths weren't properly expanded when in the home directory](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5020).
 - Fixes some itest flakes caused by [stray logs that were not in the error whitelist](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5016).
 - Resolves some [htlcswitch unit test flakes that would trigger if the test ran longer than expected](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5026).

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.12.1-beta.rc4.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.12.1-beta.rc4.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.1-beta.rc4&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.1-beta.rc4&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

# Release Notes

## Spec Compatibility

 - 0.12.1-beta.rc4 fixes a [recently discovered edge-case in the spec](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/issues/794) surrounding retransmission of `RevokeAndAck` and `CommitSig` that can lead to channel force closures if they are not retransmitted in the same order upon reconnection. This version now [persists this extra state required to determine the correct transmission order](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4915), [in accordance with the new spec requirements](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/810). This eliminates a potential vector for channel desynchronization on restart once both sides of the channel have updated and a successful state transition is performed.
 - Prior to this version, `lnd` may have incorrectly attempted an MPP payment even if the receiver's `NodeAnnouncement` or invoice did not set the MPP feature bit. This was caused by a bug that incorrectly assumed support for `payment_secrets` implied support for MPP. A fix has been applied that [limits the maximum number of splits to 1 when the receiver doesn't support MPP](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4924).

## Gossip Propagation Improvements

This release [reverts the removal of the premature channel update cache](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5003) that was removed in 0.12.0-beta. Absence of the cache was seen to cause issues with channel update propagation, so the change is reverted to restore the pre-0.12.0-beta behavior and stability. The current plan is to reschedule the cache's removal for 0.13 after performing more extensive investigation.
 
In addition, the gossip throttling adding in v0.12.0 has been [refactored to be less aggressive with respect to non-keepalive channel updates](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5006), i.e. channel updates that differ in more than just the timestamp. Previously `lnd` would drop all but the first such update that it received over the course of a block, which has reportedly been too restrictive and resulted in degraded propagation of routine channel updates.

The new throttling logic now employs a directional [token bucket rate limiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket), the same approach used by `lnd` to rate-limit gossip requests from sync peers. Each token bucket is configured to drop non-keepalive updates arriving faster that once per minute, yet permitting bursts of up 10 updates. This improves on the previous approach in a few ways:
 - Updates are now limited with respect to a consistent time source, i.e. seconds, rather than block height. This makes it easier to reason about when channel updates might get dropped as an average user, and places a deterministic bound on the next time a normal user can reliably update their channel again.
 - The rate limits are now applied _directionally_, so that one end of the channel cannot cause their counterparty's channel updates to be dropped. This has the effect of making the penalization more precise, and better targets individuals that exhibit abusive behavior.
 - By factoring in bursts, it provides enough tolerance for cases where policy changes that may occur in quick succession, e.g. disable followed by reenable, or modifying a channel policy immediately after open.

## No Gossip Mode

This release includes support for a [no-graph sync mode](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4945) which can be enabled by setting `numgraphsyncpeers=0`. In prior versions, running `lnd` in this configuration would still trigger an initial historical sync with the first connected peer on each restart. The behavior was modified under the assumption that users who have already configured `lnd` to not receive gossip updates probably don't want to sync the graph at all.

This mode is especially helpful to wallet developers that choose to outsource pathfinding via their own service, or purely forwarding nodes that never need to perform pathfinding.

## Pinned Gossip Syncers

Typically `lnd` performs this historical channel reconciliation periodically, rotating between the set of all active peers, and attempting to keep `numgraphsyncpeers` (defaults to 3) in a state where they are receiving new gossip messages. Due to the eventually consistent properties of this algorithm (and the gossip protocol in general), there are some cases that lead to long delays in a node receiving newer updates. Notably, if a node has many peers, then it may be a while before the sync rotation algorithm queries a given peer for newer updates.

To provide more control, a new configuration option has been added [allowing users to _pin_ their nodes into an ActiveSync with particular nodes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4934). Each time a connection is established with a pinned syncer, `lnd` will first perform a historical channel reconciliation, followed by a request for the pinned syncer to forward all new gossip messages. Doing so allows users to keep their routing table tightly synchronized with nodes in their list of configured, pinned syncers. Users can add one or more pinned syncers via:
```
gossip.pinned-syncers=&lt;pubkey1&gt;
gossip.pinned-syncers=&lt;pubkey2&gt;
```
This can be especially useful for services that run multiple, well-connected `lnd` nodes, and want their own nodes to maintain similar views of the channel graph. Users can also use `gossip.pinned-syncers` in combination with `numgraphsyncpeers=0` to only sync from a specific peer.

## RPC Changes
 - `lnd` 0.12.1-beta.rc4 now [exposes the HTLC `attempt_id` on response from `TrackPayment`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4956). Internally, `lnd` uses `attempt_id` as a unique identifier for each HTLC it sends out, and to provide a total ordering on all HTLC sent by the daemon.  This identifier can be used by developers to better reflect progress of a payment, making it easier to extract per-HTLC state deltas rather than displaying the full payment state every time.
- Changes the default value of the `max-parts` argument to `SendPayment` from 1 to 16. When called without any arguments previously, `lnd` would only ever attempt paths with 1 HTLC, and give up if it couldn't find such a path. This change makes it so that `lnd` will attempt to make payments using a small number of shards if it can't be done using a single HTLC. 
- Adds a new `MaxShardSizeMsat` argument to `SendPayment`, allowing users to cap the maximum value of any MPP shard sent out by `lnd`. Users can now set this from `lncli` via either the `max_shard_size_sat` or `max_shard_size_msat` field. 


## Deterministic Build / Release Verification
 - The signature verification script [was fixed to no longer fail if a public key of a signature is missing](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4963) and @halseth's [signing public keys were added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4962).
 - The [golang version `1.15.7`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4961) is now used for compilation across all build processes.
 - The release process has been modified to [clean any generated mobile stubs before packaging/verifying the release](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4983). Without doing so, users would arrive at a different `vendor.tar.gz` depending on whether or not they had previously run `make mobile` due to small differences in the imports present in the project.
 - Fixed an issue that allowed GO_VERSION of the release toolchain to be spuriously updated to newer releases of go. This was hit unexpectedly in the v0.12.1-beta.rc2 release cycle where the release binaries were built with go1.15.8, which had been released earlier in the week, rather than go1.15.7 which is pinned in our release/verify docker containers. As a result, building the release locally did not match the binaries uploaded by github to the release. We resolved this by _exactly_ [pinning the GO_VERSION used to compile the release binaries](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5013).
 - Allows users to [pass custom paths for `lnd` or `lncli` when verifying binaries](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5021).
 - Switches the [signing on the release manfest to use detached signatures](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5019) rather than clear signing the manifest.
 - The release [verification script now requires 5 of the 7 developer signatures on the manifest](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5023) before attempting to verify the hashes of `lnd` or `lncli`.

## Developer Toolchain
 - Some of the GitHub Action scripts [were replaced by vendored scripts](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4952) to prevent secret extraction through malicious code.
 - The build process was [enhanced with a `make imports`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2162) command that organizes all golang import statements.
 - The protobuf definitions are now compiled [using docker](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4911) to avoid needing to install a set of binaries and libraries with exact pinned versions. The instructions on how to [format the proto files with MacOS](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4944) were added as well.

## Bug Fixes
 - Fixes a bug that can result in a [panic when generating hodl invoices for private channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4978). An [itest has also been added for generating hodl invoices using private channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4996) to provide more complete coverage of this area going forward.
 - Squashes a bug that results in a [startup error when the daemon exits while in the middle of processing graph updates for its own channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4958).
 - Creates a [fast-path for persisting locally-created gossip messages](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4964) rather than waiting to be batched with remote graph updates. This reduces the likelihood of partially-writes for local graph updates, which was partially patched in https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4958.
 - The development docker files were [fixed by adding an extra listener](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4938) to make sure the beginner tutorial can be followed without running into errors.
 - Fixes an [error message returned when attempting to bind a REST listener on a public interface without authentication](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4993), such that it returns the relevant configuration flag (`no-rest-tls`).
 - Fixes an issue with [IPv6 address resolution when using `tor.active`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4988) such that `lnd` will fall back to the system resolver.
 - Fixes an issue with [IP alias resolution](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5007) such that `lnd` will fall back to the system resolver.
 - Fixes a bug where [SCB file paths weren't properly expanded when in the home directory](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5020).
 - Fixes some itest flakes caused by [stray logs that were not in the error whitelist](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5016).
 - Resolves some [htlcswitch unit test flakes that would trigger if the test ran longer than expected](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5026).

    <summary>**A newer version is already available! Please don’t use this version anymore.**

This is a hotfix that fixes a [startup issue](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5191) with limit offers.

Here are the release notes from v1.5.5:

## Release notes

ATTENTION: This release changes the trade protocol. 

**DO NOT specify trade ID or any other value in the 'reason for payment' field.
LEAVE IT BLANK.** 

If it is mandatory for your payment service add a dash character ('-') or coordinate with your counterparty over trader chat to agree on a reason for payment.

This change reduces the chances that certain payment accounts get flagged. 
Please see https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/2869 for more details on this change.

This release introduces the option to create limit offers to be able to deactivate an offer if a certain price limit is reached. It also introduces cash-by-mail as a new payment method. In addition to multiple minor UI changes, we squashed lots of bugs and improved reliability and performance of the app across the board.

### Assets
No new assets.

## Verification

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.5.6.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
`shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/Java/Bisq-1.5.6.jar`
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.5.6.jar.txt file.


## Known issues with installation 

### macOS Catalina:

&gt; Bisq can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

This happens the first time Bisq is run on macOS Catalina. It is because a new security feature in Catalina has newer requirements of how apps are packaged. We are working on ways to address this (see #3402 and #4196 for details).

Workaround: Right click on the installed Bisq app &gt; Click `Open` (warning popup shown again, but with new button available) &gt; Click `Open`

&gt; Bisq would like to receive keystrokes from any application.

Discussed in issue https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373, you will see a permission request in the latest macOS version that Bisq wants to receive keystrokes from any application. Unfortunately that is an issue for all Java applications that are run on Catalina right now. We are investigating already how to solve this issue and will fix in one of our next updates.

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/Bisq/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.5.6.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.1-beta.rc3"/>
    <summary># Database Migrations

There are no migrations in `lnd` v0.12.1-beta.rc3.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-bitconner-v0.12.1-beta.rc3.txt.asc` is in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-bitconner-v0.12.1-beta.rc3.txt.asc
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Thu Feb 11 18:44:20 2021 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 9C8D61868A7C492003B2744EE7D737B67FA592C7
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Conner Fromknecht &lt;conner@lightning.engineering&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc3.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc3.txt.asc.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc3.txt.asc
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.15.7`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, and `watchtowerrpc`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.12.1-beta.rc3
gpg: Signature made Thu Feb 11 18:03:36 2021 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 9C8D61868A7C492003B2744EE7D737B67FA592C7
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Conner Fromknecht &lt;conner@lightning.engineering&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker pull lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.1-beta.rc3
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.1-beta.rc3 /verify-install.sh
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.12.1-beta.rc3.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.12.1-beta.rc3.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.1-beta.rc3&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.1-beta.rc3&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

# Release Notes

## Spec Compatibility

 - 0.12.1-beta.rc3 fixes a [recently discovered edge-case in the spec](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/issues/794) surrounding retransmission of `RevokeAndAck` and `CommitSig` that can lead to channel force closures if they are not retransmitted in the same order upon reconnection. This version now [persists this extra state required to determine the correct transmission order](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4915), [in accordance with the new spec requirements](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/810). This eliminates a potential vector for channel desynchronization on restart once both sides of the channel have updated and a successful state transition is performed.
 - Prior to this version, `lnd` may have incorrectly attempted an MPP payment even if the receiver's `NodeAnnouncement` or invoice did not set the MPP feature bit. This was caused by a bug that incorrectly assumed support for `payment_secrets` implied support for MPP. A fix has been applied that [limits the maximum number of splits to 1 when the receiver doesn't support MPP](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4924).

## Gossip Propagation Improvements

This release [reverts the removal of the premature channel update cache](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5003) that was removed in 0.12.0-beta. Absence of the cache was seen to cause issues with channel update propagation, so the change is reverted to restore the pre-0.12.0-beta behavior and stability. The current plan is to reschedule the cache's removal for 0.13 after performing more extensive investigation.
 
In addition, the gossip throttling adding in v0.12.0 has been [refactored to be less aggressive with respect to non-keepalive channel updates](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5006), i.e. channel updates that differ in more than just the timestamp. Previously `lnd` would drop all but the first such update that it received over the course of a block, which has reportedly been too restrictive and resulted in degraded propagation of routine channel updates.

The new throttling logic now employs a directional [token bucket rate limiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket), the same approach used by `lnd` to rate-limit gossip requests from sync peers. Each token bucket is configured to drop non-keepalive updates arriving faster that once per minute, yet permitting bursts of up 10 updates. This improves on the previous approach in a few ways:
 - Updates are now limited with respect to a consistent time source, i.e. seconds, rather than block height. This makes it easier to reason about when channel updates might get dropped as an average user, and places a deterministic bound on the next time a normal user can reliably update their channel again.
 - The rate limits are now applied _directionally_, so that one end of the channel cannot cause their counterparty's channel updates to be dropped. This has the effect of making the penalization more precise, and better targets individuals that exhibit abusive behavior.
 - By factoring in bursts, it provides enough tolerance for cases where policy changes that may occur in quick succession, e.g. disable followed by reenable, or modifying a channel policy immediately after open.

## No Gossip Mode

This release includes support for a [no-graph sync mode](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4945) which can be enabled by setting `numgraphsyncpeers=0`. In prior versions, running `lnd` in this configuration would still trigger an initial historical sync with the first connected peer on each restart. The behavior was modified under the assumption that users who have already configured `lnd` to not receive gossip updates probably don't want to sync the graph at all.

This mode is especially helpful to wallet developers that choose to outsource pathfinding via their own service, or purely forwarding nodes that never need to perform pathfinding.

## Pinned Gossip Syncers

Typically `lnd` performs this historical channel reconciliation periodically, rotating between the set of all active peers, and attempting to keep `numgraphsyncpeers` (defaults to 3) in a state where they are receiving new gossip messages. Due to the eventually consistent properties of this algorithm (and the gossip protocol in general), there are some cases that lead to long delays in a node receiving newer updates. Notably, if a node has many peers, then it may be a while before the sync rotation algorithm queries a given peer for newer updates.

To provide more control, a new configuration option has been added [allowing users to _pin_ their nodes into an ActiveSync with particular nodes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4934). Each time a connection is established with a pinned syncer, `lnd` will first perform a historical channel reconciliation, followed by a request for the pinned syncer to forward all new gossip messages. Doing so allows users to keep their routing table tightly synchronized with nodes in their list of configured, pinned syncers. Users can add one or more pinned syncers via:
```
gossip.pinned-syncers=&lt;pubkey1&gt;
gossip.pinned-syncers=&lt;pubkey2&gt;
```
This can be especially useful for services that run multiple, well-connected `lnd` nodes, and want their own nodes to maintain similar views of the channel graph. Users can also use `gossip.pinned-syncers` in combination with `numgraphsyncpeers=0` to only sync from a specific peer.

## RPC Changes
 - `lnd` 0.12.1-beta.rc3 now [exposes the HTLC `attempt_id` on response from `TrackPayment`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4956). Internally, `lnd` uses `attempt_id` as a unique identifier for each HTLC it sends out, and to provide a total ordering on all HTLC sent by the daemon.  This identifier can be used by developers to better reflect progress of a payment, making it easier to extract per-HTLC state deltas rather than displaying the full payment state every time.


## Deterministic Build / Release Verification
 - The signature verification script [was fixed to no longer fail if a public key of a signature is missing](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4963) and @halseth's [signing public keys were added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4962).
 - The [golang version `1.15.7`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4961) is now used for compilation across all build processes.
 - The release process has been modified to [clean any generated mobile stubs before packaging/verifying the release](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4983). Without doing so, users would arrive at a different `vendor.tar.gz` depending on whether or not they had previously run `make mobile` due to small differences in the imports present in the project.
 - Fixed an issue that allowed GO_VERSION of the release toolchain to be spuriously updated to newer releases of go. This was hit unexpectedly in the v0.12.1-beta.rc2 release cycle where the release binaries were built with go1.15.8, which had been released earlier in the week, rather than go1.15.7 which is pinned in our release/verify docker containers. As a result, building the release locally did not match the binaries uploaded by github to the release. We resolved this by _exactly_ [pinning the GO_VERSION used to compile the release binaries](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5013).

## Developer Toolchain
 - Some of the GitHub Action scripts [were replaced by vendored scripts](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4952) to prevent secret extraction through malicious code.
 - The build process was [enhanced with a `make imports`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2162) command that organizes all golang import statements.
 - The protobuf definitions are now compiled [using docker](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4911) to avoid needing to install a set of binaries and libraries with exact pinned versions. The instructions on how to [format the proto files with MacOS](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4944) were added as well.

## Bug Fixes
 - Fixes a bug that can result in a [panic when generating hodl invoices for private channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4978). An [itest has also been added for generating hodl invoices using private channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4996) to provide more complete coverage of this area going forward.
 - Squashes a bug that results in a [startup error when the daemon exits while in the middle of processing graph updates for its own channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4958).
 - Creates a [fast-path for persisting locally-created gossip messages](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4964) rather than waiting to be batched with remote graph updates. This reduces the likelihood of partially-writes for local graph updates, which was partially patched in https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4958.
 - The development docker files were [fixed by adding an extra listener](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4938) to make sure the beginner tutorial can be followed without running into errors.
 - Fixes an [error message returned when attempting to bind a REST listener on a public interface without authentication](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4993), such that it returns the relevant configuration flag (`no-rest-tls`).
 - Fixes an issue with [IPv6 address resolution when using `tor.active`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4988) such that `lnd` will fall back to the system resolver.
 - Fixes an issue with [IP alias resolution](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5007) such that `lnd` will fall back to the system resolver.

    <summary># v0.5.0 - The release who must not be named

## Running Bitcoin-S

If you want to run the standalone server binary, after verifying gpg signatures, you
can `unzip bitcoin-s-server-0.5.0.zip` and then run it with `./bin/bitcoin-s-server` to start the node. You will need to
configure the node properly first, you can find example
configurations [here](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/config/configuration#example-configuration-file).

You can then unzip the `bitcoin-s-cli-0.5.0.zip` folder and start using the `bitcoin-s-cli` like this:

```bashrc

## Running the oracle server

If you want to run the standalone oracle server binary, after verifying gpg signatures, you
can `unzip bitcoin-s-oracle-server-0.5.0.zip` and then run it with `./bin/bitcoin-s-oracle-server` to start the node. You will need to
configure the node properly first, you can find example
configurations [here](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/config/configuration#example-configuration-file).

You can then unzip the `bitcoin-s-cli-0.5.0.zip` folder and start using the `bitcoin-s-cli` like this:

```bashrc
./bin/bitcoin-s-cli --help
Usage: bitcoin-s-cli [options] [&lt;cmd&gt;]

  -n, --network &lt;value&gt;    Select the active network.
  --debug                  Print debugging information
  --rpcport &lt;value&gt;        The port to send our rpc request to on the server
  -h, --help               Display this help message and exit
```

## Verifying signatures

This release is signed with [Chris's signing key](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/security#disclosure) with
fingerprint `339A49229576050819083EB3F99724872F822910`

To do the verification, first hash the executable using `sha256sum`. You should check that the result is listed in
the `SHA256SUMS.asc` file next to its file name. After doing that you can use `gpg --verify` to authenticate the
signature.

Example:

```
$ sha256sum bitcoin-s-server-0.5.0.zip
59c14b9fa27731d7a97f61145569619c5c497c22a976add7e554ea063c63d373  bitcoin-s-server-0.5.0.zip
$  gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
gpg: Signature made Thu 04 Feb 2021 12:49:59 PM CST
gpg:                using RSA key 339A49229576050819083EB3F99724872F822910
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Chris Stewart &lt;stewart.chris1234@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [unknown]

## BREAKING CHANGES to Configuration Options

It is required that all wallets pre #2217 need to have the configuration

&gt; bitcoin-s.wallet.aesPassword = &quot;changeMe&quot;

See [issue #2245](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/issues/2245) for the errors that are thrown when this isn't set.

This password can be changed now with the `keymanagerpassphrasechange` RPC command.

## Multi Wallet Support

Initial support for saving multiple seeds and wallets has been added to Bitcoin-S!
This does not yet allow you to load and use multiple wallets at once, but you can switch between wallets using the
`bitcoin-s.wallet.walletName` config option.

## Module Level Changes

### Bitcoind RPC Client

The Bitcoind RPC Client now has support for v0.20 &amp; v0.21!

The Bitcoind RPC Client now has support for using it with a bitcoind that has multiple wallets loaded, this is done by
setting the `walletName` parameter in the required functions.

### Chain

The `ChainHandler` has been split up into two different types: `ChainHandler` and `CachedChainHandler`.

`CachedChainHandler` stores in memory the latest block headers and allows for faster syncing.
`ChainHandler` uses the chain database to access all data, this is necessary for things like the wallet to be able to
point to a single `ChainApi` and not get outdated data.

Neutrino syncing should be faster after some optimizations.

### CLI

New CLI commands have been added such as `decodepsbt`, `getblockheader`, and `bumpfeecpfp`. For a full list of available CLI
commands check [the docs](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/0.5.0/applications/server#server-endpoints).

The `Cli` module is now published as a library, this should allow other projects to easily interact with a Bitcoin-S server.

The `cli` is also published using the `sbt-native-image` plugin. (#2494)

Initial BIP 155 support for sending and receiving addrv2 messages.

Initial BIP 325 support for interacting with Signet.

Experimental TLV support for DLC messaging, data structures, and algorithms.
These are subject to change and if your project is looking to use them
it is recommended to use [nightly builds](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/getting-started#nightly-builds) to stay up to date.

### Crypto

ECDSA Adaptor signatures have been added in a basic Java implementation.
These should be used with caution as they are experimental and still being developed.
They are based on the specification located [here](https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/pull/114),
however they do not fully follow the specification and will be updated in the future.

Low R Signing should now use the same algorithm as Bitcoin Core.
Previously our first attempted signature would use different added entropy.

### DLC Oracle

The DLC Oracle is a new module in Bitcoin-S!
The DLC Oracle allows you to attest to events and sign their outcomes for DLC participants.

The DLC Oracle can be used to as a standalone module or as an RPC server.
You can check out the [documentation](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/oracle/oracle-server) to find out more.

This is still in beta and is likely to have some breaking changes in the future. As of this release, it is up to date
with the [DLC Spec](https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs).

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.1-beta.rc1"/>
    <summary># Database Migrations

There are no database migrations in v0.12.1-beta.rc1.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-bitconner-v0.12.1-beta.rc1.txt.asc` is in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-bitconner-v0.12.1-beta.rc1.txt.asc
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Wed Feb  3 22:51:31 2021 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 9C8D61868A7C492003B2744EE7D737B67FA592C7
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Conner Fromknecht &lt;conner@lightning.engineering&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc1.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc1.txt.asc.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.1-beta.rc1.txt.asc
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.15.7`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, and `watchtowerrpc`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.12.1-beta.rc1
gpg: Signature made Wed Feb  3 22:09:02 2021 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 9C8D61868A7C492003B2744EE7D737B67FA592C7
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Conner Fromknecht &lt;conner@lightning.engineering&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker pull lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.1-beta.rc1
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.1-beta.rc1 /verify-install.sh
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.12.1-beta.rc1.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.12.1-beta.rc1.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.1-beta.rc1&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.1-beta.rc1&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

# Release Notes

## Spec Compatibility

 - 0.12.1-beta.rc1 fixes a [recently discovered edge-case in the spec](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/issues/794) surrounding retransmission of `RevokeAndAck` and `CommitSig` that can lead to channel force closures if they are not retransmitted in the same order upon reconnection. This version now [persists this extra state required to determine the correct transmission order](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4915), [in accordance with the new spec requirements](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/810). This eliminates a potential vector for channel desynchronization on restart once both sides of the channel have updated and a successful state transition is performed.
 - Prior to this version, `lnd` may have incorrectly attempted an MPP payment even if the receiver's `NodeAnnouncement` or invoice did not set the MPP feature bit. This was caused by a bug that incorrectly assumed support for `payment_secrets` implied support for MPP. A fix has been applied that [limits the maximum number of splits to 1 when the receiver doesn't support MPP](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4924).

## Pinned Gossip Syncers

Typically `lnd` performs this historical channel reconciliation periodically, rotating between the set of all active peers, and attempting to keep `numgraphsyncpeers` (defaults to 3) in a state where they are receiving new gossip messages. Due to the eventually consistent properties of this algorithm (and the gossip protocol in general), there are some cases that lead to long delays in a node receiving newer updates. Notably, if a node has many peers, then it may be a while before the sync rotation algorithm queries a given peer for newer updates.

To provide more control, a new configuration option has been added allowing users to _pin_ their nodes into an ActiveSync with particular nodes. Each time a connection is established with a pinned syncer, `lnd` will first perform a historical channel reconciliation, followed by a request for the pinned syncer to forward all new gossip messages. Doing so allows users to keep their routing table tightly synchronized with nodes in their list of configured, pinned syncers. Users can add one or more pinned syncers via:
```
gossip.pinned-syncers=&lt;pubkey1&gt;
gossip.pinned-syncers=&lt;pubkey2&gt;
```
This can be especially useful for services that run multiple, well-connected `lnd` nodes, and want their own nodes to maintain similar views of the channel graph.

## RPC Changes
 - `lnd` 0.12.1-beta.rc1 now [exposes the HTLC `attempt_id` on response from `TrackPayment`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4956). Internally, `lnd` uses `attempt_id` as a unique identifier for each HTLC it sends out, and to provide a total ordering on all HTLC sent by the daemon.  This identifier can be used by developers to better reflect progress of a payment, making it easier to extract per-HTLC state deltas rather than displaying the full payment state every time.

## Build / verification
 - Some of the GitHub Action scripts [were replaced by vendored scripts](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4952) to prevent secret extraction through malicious code.
 - The signature verification script [was fixed to no longer fail if a public key of a signature is missing](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4963) and [more signing public keys were added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4962).
 - The build process was [enhanced with a `make imports`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2162) command that organizes all golang import statements.
 - The protobuf definitions are now compiled [using docker](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4911) to avoid needing to install a set of binaries and libraries with exact pinned versions. The instructions on how to [format the proto files with MacOS](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4944) were added as well.
 - The [golang version `1.15.7`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4961) is now used for compilation across all build processes.

## Bug Fixes
 - Fixes a bug that can result in a [panic when generating hodl invoices for private channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4978).
 - Squashes a bug that results in a [startup error when the daemon exits while in the middle of processing graph updates for its own channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4958).
 - The development docker files were [fixed by adding an extra listener](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4938) to make sure the beginner tutorial can be followed without running into errors.

    <summary>## Display min amount for pay-to-open

The minimum amount that the wallet can receive is now displayed when the wallet does not have any channels. It is also displayed for swap-ins. This minimum amount prevents creating new channels for very small amounts.

## Release notes

ATTENTION: This release changes the trade protocol. 

**DO NOT specify trade ID or any other value in the 'reason for payment' field.
LEAVE IT BLANK.** 

If it is mandatory for your payment service add a dash character ('-') or coordinate with your counterparty over trader chat to agree on a reason for payment.

This change reduces the chances that certain payment accounts get flagged. 
Please see https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/2869 for more details on this change.

This release introduces the option to create limit offers to be able to deactivate an offer if a certain price limit is reached. It also introduces cash-by-mail as a new payment method. In addition to multiple minor UI changes, we squashed lots of bugs and improved reliability and performance of the app across the board.

### Assets
No new assets.

## Verification

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.5.5.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
`shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/Java/Bisq-1.5.5.jar`
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.5.5.jar.txt file.


## Known issues with installation 

### macOS Catalina:

&gt; Bisq can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

This happens the first time Bisq is run on macOS Catalina. It is because a new security feature in Catalina has newer requirements of how apps are packaged. We are working on ways to address this (see #3402 and #4196 for details).

Workaround: Right click on the installed Bisq app &gt; Click `Open` (warning popup shown again, but with new button available) &gt; Click `Open`

&gt; Bisq would like to receive keystrokes from any application.

Discussed in issue https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373, you will see a permission request in the latest macOS version that Bisq wants to receive keystrokes from any application. Unfortunately that is an issue for all Java applications that are run on Catalina right now. We are investigating already how to solve this issue and will fix in one of our next updates.

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/Bisq/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.5.5.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.0-beta"/>
    <summary>This release marks the first major release in the `v0.12.x` series! As this is a major release several new features are included in this release including: anchor commitment types are now the default, anchor commitment support for watchtowers, new arguments to auto compact the database as well as drop the `wtxmgr` state, generic wallet PSBT crafting+signing, and much more! As usual, this release contains several important bug fixes, so we recommend all users update. 

# Database Migrations
A migration to initialize a top-level peers bucket is included in this release. The bucket is used to track flap counts for peers that we have channels open with across restarts. These values are used to rate-limit the amount of memory that `lnd` uses to track peers online state, ensuring that we do not store large volumes of uptime information for peers that are constantly changing online state.

This release contains a migration to initialize a top-level-bucket for an outpoint index. There is also a subsequent migration that populates this index with an outpoint's status. This will cut down on expensive `bbolt` transactions throughout the codebase. The migration process should look something like this upon initial start up:
```

```
# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.0-beta.txt.asc` is in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.0-beta.txt.asc
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Tue Jan 26 23:22:18 2021 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.0-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.0-beta.txt.asc.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.0-beta.txt.asc
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.15.7`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, and `watchtowerrpc`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.12.0-beta
gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Jan 2021 02:29:33 AM UTC using RSA key ID 9B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot;
Primary key fingerprint: E4D8 5299 674B 2D31 FAA1  892E 372C BD76 33C6 1696
     Subkey fingerprint: 60A1 FA7D A5BF F08B DCBB  E790 3BBD 59E9 9B28 0306
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker pull lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.0-beta
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.0-beta /verify-install.sh
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.12.0-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.12.0-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.0-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.0-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

# Release Notes

## New Default Autopilot Heuristic

[In this version of `lnd`, the default heursitic for autopilot has been changed from preferential attachment, to a version that will attempt to optimize for the betweeness centrality of the node](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4668). At a high level, this change means that rather than trying to connect (stochastically) to the nodes that have the _most_ channels, `lnd` will instead attempt to connect to the nodes that [appear most often in the shortest paths within the network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality). This change will serve to step as a stepping stone to further diffuse the graph to make it more resilient. 

## Pathfinding Improvements 

[`lnd` will now properly penalize attempts of larger &quot;wumbo&quot; sized payments proportionally](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4602). This will serve to ensure that clients with less active failure information are able to properly prune the search space by increasing the _attempt_ cost for larger payments. New flags has been added to allow users to configure the attempt cost for this value (`attemptcost` and `attemptcostppm`). We encourage users taht frequently send larger payments to tweak these parameters to find what works best, and ideally communicate this information back to the maintainers of `lnd` so we can better tune the current default value. 

## Graph Download Optimizations 

[`lnd` will now _batch_ all insertion operations related to channel graph which should _greatly_ speed up initial graph download](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/3367). Initial becnhmarks show this change resluting in a 3x speed increase, with further gains likely being seen on mobile and more constrained platforms. 

## Peer to Peer Updates 

[A new flag has been added to `lnd` to enforce a _global_ connection timeout when trying to connect out to new peers](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4452). Setting a lower value for this new command line option (`timeout`) will mean that `lnd` will give up on unreachable peers much sooner than before, which can be useful when attempting to connect to a set of addresses to open channel to a peer. 


## Automatic Database Compaction

The most important data of any `lnd` node is stored in its channel database (`channel.db`). The database library currently used for this DB is `bbolt` which by design does not give back free space to the file system, even if data is deleted from the DB. This can lead to large DB files and slow startup times. Compaction is the process of creating a fresh copy of a `bbolt` database that only contains data and no &quot;reserved free space&quot;. This process also de-fragments and validates the integrity of the data.

[Automatic compaction of the `channel.db` can now be turned on](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4667) with the flag `--db.bolt.auto-compact`. By default this will compact on startup, if the last compaction was more than a week ago. The flag `--db.bolt.auto-compact-min-age` can also be set to `0` to force compaction on every startup, independent of how long ago it happened last.


## Protocol Upgrades

### Anchor Output Channels
`lnd` will now open the new channel type dubbed &quot;anchor channels&quot; by default if both peers support it. You signal support by setting the `--protocol.anchors` flag at `lnd` startup. This is a channel type that has been available to advanced users [since lnd v0.10](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.10.0-beta), but it has seen a few updates that makes it [even safer](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4840) and useful in high fee scenarios, and it is now in line with [a proposed BOLT change](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/824).

The anchor channel type is a new type of channel that is much safer in high fee scenarios, as it allows bumping the fees after the channel has been force closed, instead of making the peers agreeing on a future close fee. This is also a nice UX improvement, as less of the channel capacity needs to go towards the commitment fee reserve, and can instead be used for payments. In addition it allows [bundling multiple HTLC transactions](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4779) together into one, potentially saving on chain fees in force close scenarios.

The commitment transaction still needs to be signed up front with a fee that ensures its mempool acceptance, and this [fee now defaults](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4855) to 10 sat/vbyte. This can be tuned by the `--max-commit-fee-rate-anchors` flag, but this should be used with caution. 

Note that one has to have on-chain funds available in the wallet for fee bumping channel closes for anchor channels. Because of this, a small portion of the wallet balance will be reserved for this purpose, and some on-chain actions that used to be allowed can now be rejected if you have anchor channels open.

### Static Remote Key Feature Bit Required

[This new version of `lnd` now requires channels that use a static remote key, AKA &quot;tweakless commitments&quot;](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4751). This change improves safety and security for users as now when a channel is force closed by the remote party, the funds will go directly to a user control key. Prior versions of  `lnd` have supported this channel type, but `lnd` will now **only** allow this type of channel when making channels with new peer.

Lnd will [waive this requirement](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4847) in the case where it still has legacy channels with a peer. This ensures that lnd can still connect to nodes it has existing channels with, even if they do not understand the feature bit. 

### Improved End to End Payment Security 

The MPP protocol upgrade included a so called &quot;payment address&quot; that improves end-to-end payment security by requiring the sender to include a special nonce in the onion payload specify by the receiver. As intermediate nodes can't guess this secret ahead of time, and it's encrypted in the onion only to the finally receiver, they thwarts a large class of probing and de-anonymization attacks. [This new release of `lnd` will now _require_ this feature bit set in any new invoices it creates](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4752), which means all payments that don't include this new payment secret will be rejected. 


## PSBT Signing

The internal wallet can now [create and sign PSBTs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4389). In combination with the `ListUnspent` RPC this allows RPC users to implement full coin control.
This feature also takes us one step closer to the goal of supporting watch-only on-chain wallets in `lnd` where an online node would only have public keys to track the UTXOs and would delegate the signing to a non-networked `lnd` node that has the private keys, all through using PSBTs.
Read more about the possible use cases and dive into the examples [in our PSBT documentation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/psbt.md).

## Build System

Leveraging the power of GitHub Workflows, we now [automatically build and push docker images](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4769) of all our releases [to Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/lightninglabs). This includes images for `amd64` and [`arm64`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4852).

The distinction between the production `Dockerfile` and the development `dev.Dockerfile` [were made more clear in the documentation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4790).

The release binaries for all OS/architectures are now [also built by a GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4777). The deterministic build system introduced in a previous release allows us to independently build and sign the binaries locally. Signatures of more than just one developer will be added to releases in the future.

The experiential build tag has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4701) for the `assumechanvalid` flag that is used to prevent long rescans for neutrino nodes.

## Continuous Integration

Our continuous integration pipeline, most notably our integration tests, has received a number of improvements and bug fixes making them considerably faster and somewhat more stable:
- An integration test suite running [against a `bitcoind` with the TX index disabled](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4617) was added.
- The ~70 integration tests are now [split into 4 parts and run in parallel](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4655) reducing the execution time by ~50%.
- Log files are only uploaded to termbin.com and file.io [for failed runs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4623) and the `bitcoind` binaries are [extracted from a docker image instead of being downloaded](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4623), shaving off a few more minutes from the total itest execution time.
- The test harness for the `btcd` node used as the mining node [were improved to fix port collisions](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4765) which resulted in flaky tests.
- A check was added that [forces new command line flags to also be documented in the `sample-lnd.conf` file](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4626).
- A new make target [for itest flake hunting](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4756) was added.
- New make targets [for running fuzz tests](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4643) were added.
- Build tags were removed from the integration test files, [allowing the linter to check those as well](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4593).
- The `zpay32` package's `Decode` and `Encode` functions now have [corresponding fuzz tests](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4651) in the `fuzz` package.
- The `brontide` fuzz tests have been [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4640).
- Fuzz testing has been [optimized](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4682) to instruct `gofuzz` to always mutate the input.

## Contract Court Performance Improvements
Performance [improvements](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4697) were made to the contract court subsystem which is responsible for closing out channels on chain and taking on-chain actions required to fully resolve the channel. The number of database transactions required to start up the subsystem has been reduced from one per channel to a single transaction, which reduces startup time. Improvements to the way the subsystem consumes new blocks from its backing bitcoin node have also improved the memory footprint of the system. 

## Extended Health Checks 

[A new optional `healthcheck` has been added to insturct `lnd` to restart itself in order to _refresh_ an expired RPC TLS cert](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4792). This change is useful in containerized contexts such as k8s, where an auto restarting `lnd` is able to propagate any auth changes in a decoupled manner upon restart. 

## `htlcswitch` Enhancements 

Database contention has been [reduced](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4547) in the link by batching removal of forwarding packages. The removal timer has also been increased from 1 minute to 1 hour.

[A bug has been fixed in our non-strict forwarding randomization](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4659) to ensure we explicitly randomize our link selection rather than relying on the undefined ordering of map interation in the Go spec.

## Gossip Enhancements

During the development of this release, an increase in high disk usage was reported by several users throughout the network due to channel update spam. To minimize the effects to disks, `lnd` will now [rate limit channel updates in two ways](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4786). Keep-alive updates, those which only increase their timestamps to signal liveliness, are now limited to one per rebroadcast interval (current default of 24H). Non-keep-alive updates are now limited to one per block per direction.

As required by the specification, `lnd` now [enforces all channels for a block must fit within a single reply](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4804). It would previously not enforce this as it would allow an overlap of blocks across multiple replies, which could lead other implementations to send us a error due to the overlap and cause connect/disconnect cycles.

`lnd` will [no longer accept premature channel announcements/updates and wait for their maturity](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4895).

## Peer Flap Rate Tracking

An [update](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4440) to the channel fitness subsystem has introduced tracking of the number of times lnd is connected and disconnected from each of its peers. This information is surfaced in the output of the `ListPeers` API. 

The flap rate we have recorded for peers is also used to rate limit the amount of data lnd will store to track the peer’s uptime. If a peer has a high flap rate, lnd will reduce the amount of data it stores in memory, resulting in more aggregated uptime information. This change is intended to protect against constantly flapping peers, and will have little effect on peers that are consistently online with the occasional restart. To ensure that we do not permanently punish a peer for a period of instability long in the past, the flap rate we track for peers is exponentially cooled down over time. 

## RPC Enchancements &amp; Bug Fixes

### GetInfo `best_header_timestamp`

[The `best_header_timestamp` field included in the `GetInfo`'s RPC response will now be set to what the backend reports while it is syncing](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4703). This will restore the ability for higher-level applications to determine their sync progress.

### Watchtower Address Removal

[The last address of a registered watchtower can no longer be removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4746) to prevent a potential panic. 

### Uniform Unconfirmed Coin Selection for SendCoins+

[`lnd` now allows all RPC calls that craft and send transactions to spend unconfirmed coins](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4653). 

This change the following RPCs:

- `Lightning.SendCoins`
- `Lightning.SendMany`
- `WalletKit.SendOutputs`

We've added two new parameters for these methods, following the same format as used for `Lightning.OpenChannel` RPC:

- `min_confs` (default=1)
- `spend_unconfirmed` (default=false)


### Macaroon Root ID Key Rotation 

[`lnd` now supports _root ID_ key rotation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4427). This allows the baker (creator) of a set of macaroons to _invalidate_ them all by deleting and regenerating the root key used to generate the macaroons. This feature is a useful security tool, as if an application/system that uses lnd's macaroons in a fine grained manner is compromised, the admin is able to _revoke_ all generated macaroons. 

Several new calls have been added to allow users to take advantage of this feature, namely:
  * The `lncli bakemacaroon` call now accepts a new parameter: `root_key_id`. This new field is an integer that can be used to rotate root ID keys. 
  * A new `lncli listmacaroonids` command has been added to allow callers to monitor all their existing allocated root IDs.
  * A new `lncli deletemacaroonid` call has been added which implements _macaroon revocation_ by allowing the caller to _delete_ a specified root key ID. 
 
 
### New Verbose Output for `ChannelBalance`

[The `lncli channebalance` call now returns much more information than before in order to give users more insight w.r.t exactly _how_ their funds are distributed off-chain](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4512). An output of the new call resmbles the following: 
```
⛰lncli channelbalance
{
    &quot;balance&quot;: &quot;27476201&quot;,
    &quot;pending_open_balance&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
    &quot;local_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;27476201&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;27476201135&quot;
    },
    &quot;remote_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;109137173&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;109137173865&quot;
    },
    &quot;unsettled_local_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;
    },
    &quot;unsettled_remote_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;
    },
    &quot;pending_open_local_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;
    },
    &quot;pending_open_remote_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;1783362&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;1783362000&quot;
    }
}
```

Note that the first two fields (`balance` and `pending_open_balance`) are now deprecated and will be _removed_ in the future. Callers should use the new fields that return both `sat` and `msat` instead. 

### Raw Key Support for `SharedKeyRequest`

[The `DeriveSharedKey` now accepts a raw public key in addition to key locator](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4436). 

### Additional HTLC Information in ListChannels

[The `ListChannels` call will now return additional information about the set of linked HTLCs in a channel](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4693). Namely, we'll now return: 
  * The `htlc_index` of the HTLC within the channel 
  * The `forwarding_channel`, or the channel that forwarded the HTLC to the targte channel 
  * The `forwarding_htlc_index`, or the HTLC index on the forwarded channel. 

### Automated Let's Encrypt Certificates 

A new series of command line flags have been added to `lnd` which allows users to automatically obtain and renew a Let's Encrypt Certificate for the RPC interface of their `lnd` node. With this change, in certain configurations, callers will be able to hit an `lnd` now without having to manually store and update the `tls.cert` locally. 
New flags added to the `lnd` command line and `lnd.conf`:

* `--letsencryptport`: The port on which lnd will listen for Let's Encrypt challenges. Let's Encrypt will always try to contact on port 80. Often non-root processes are not allowed to bind to ports lower than 1024. This configuration option allows a different port to be used, but must be used in combination with port forwarding from port 80.
* `--letsencryptdir`: The directory to store Let's Encrypt certificates within. By default this is `.lnd/letsencrypt`.
* `--letsencryptdomain`: Request a Let's Encrypt certificate for the domain specified using this flag.

When `lncli` cannot find a `tls.cert` file, it will assume the server has a valid (Let's Encrypt) certificate. It is important to pass the domain name as a command line flag to `lncli`:

`lncli --rpcserver my.domain.org:10009`

This is necessary as well when connecting to `localhost`.

### Custom Routing Hints for AddHoldInvoice 

[The `AddHoldInvoice` RPC call now allows the users to specify their own custom routing hints](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/3672). 



### Allow No RPC Auth on Private Addresses 

[A new config evaluation has been added to allow user to instruct `lnd` that it should allow RPC requests with no authentiation _only_ if `lnd` is listening on a private address](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4473). This makes certain Docker based configurations more user friendly, as any dependent containers no longer need to obtain and update lnd's RPC authentication information. Assuming `lnd` is only listening on a non-public private interface, then the `--no-macaroons` config option is now valid.  

### New Channel Acceptor Parameters
Additional [fields](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4683) have been added to the `ChannelAcceptor` API, which allow custom setting of custom errors for the remote peer, an upfront shutdown address for the channel (if supported by the peer), and more. Note that the error provided will be sent to the peer verbatim, so should not contain sensitive information.

### Maximum Local CSV
When opening a channel, the remote party can specify the CSV delay for your funds. This value determines the amount of time that your balance will be unavailable in the case where your force close the channel. A [`max_local_csv` parameter](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4735) has been added to allow setting of custom limitations on this value. For outgoing channels, this can be set using the `max_local_csv` field in the `OpenChannel` request. The `maxlocaldelay` config value can be used to set a default maximum value for all channels.

### Disable TLS for REST
It is now possible to [disable TLS for REST RPC](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4648) using `--no-rest-tls`.

## Refactoring
This release sees the removal of several components from the main `lnd` package:
- `fundingmanager.go` and tests are [moved](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4757) to the `funding` package.
- `chainregistry.go` and `chainparams.go` have been [moved](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4487) to the `chainreg` package.
- `mock.go` has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4542) in favor of the `lntest/mock` package.
- A global variable `activeNetParams` has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4505).

The `peer` package's dependency on `brontide` has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4645).
## Miscellaneous

The DNS servers to use for initial peer bootstrapping [can now be specified](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4744) to overwrite the hard coded default values.

All supported command line flags are now [also properly documented in the `sample-lnd.conf` file](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4626).

[A new flag has been added to instruct `lnd` to timeout early if it can't obtain the file lock on bolt DB](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4787). 

### Multi node management

Hosting nodes on non-trusted (cloud) hardware was made safer by adding a [stateless initialization mode](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/1288) that instructs `lnd` to not store any unencrypted macaroons on the host's file system. Instead, the admin macaroon is returned in the response of the wallet creation request and must be stored by the caller.

To support the stateless initialization mode mentioned above on the client side as well, [configuration profiles for `lncli` can now be created](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4310). Those profiles make it easy to interact with multiple nodes from the same client machine. For additional security the macaroons stored in the profiles can optionally be encrypted with a password.

### Recovery

Forcing the on-chain wallet to rescan its state from chain was [made easier by adding the `--reset-wallet-transactions` flag](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4715) to `lnd` that replaces the functionality previously only available in the external tool `dropwtxmgr`.

### Individual subsystem log levels
A change that makes it possible to set the [log level for individual subsystems](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4772) was merged. One can now specify a global log level, and subsystem log levels that will override the global setting: `--debuglevel=debug,PEER=info,SRVR=trace`.


## Bug fixes

- A bug in [the restore logic for old SCB files](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4865) was fixed that caused the `a height hint greater than 0 must be provided` error.
- A bug was fixed in how we [watch for states on chain](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4780), that could cause us to ignore our own close transaction if we attempted recovery while our force close transaction was still in the mempool.
- All directories referenced by command line flags are [now properly created](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4622) on startup.
- Neutrino users can now [specify a full node backend with an Onion v2 address](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4806). Before this fix, only clearnet addresses were supported.
- The chain backend health check which ensures that lnd is reliably connected to a bitcoin node has been [updated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4755) to use the `uptime` api for bitcoind nodes. This check previously used the `getBlockChainInfo` API, which proved unsuitable because it could take up to 5 minutes for bitcoind to respond due to non-granular locking in core.
- A bug in the `walletrpc` subserver’s `ListSweeps` endpoint where the `verbose` output option would fail if a sweep was not found on chain has been [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4762). This could happen for transactions that were replaced-by-fee. 
- [`lnd` will no longer allow restoted channels to be manually closed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4525). This fixes a class of issues that would cause `lnd` to be unable to start due to a borked local channel state. 
- [`lnd` will no longer attempt to trap SIGABRT](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4627). 
- [A bug has been fixed related to mnemonic seed validation on restore](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4738). This ensures `lnd` will properly catch invalid words (that aren't in the wordlist) much earlier than before. 
- [All errors in the `routerrpc` server will now be properly mapped to gRPC status codes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4691). 
- [`lnd` nodes using the neutrino backend will now properly be able to connect to onion v2 onion service addresses](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4806). 
- [A bug preventing the `wtclient` from shutting down cleanly while a concurrent session negotiation is in progress has been fixed.](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4789)

    <link href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/releases/tag/v0.9.3"/>
    <summary>We're pleased to announce the 0.9.3 release of c-lightning, named by Karol Hosiawa.

This is a minor release, but it also introduces a number of new features that we're really exited about, including a number of usability improvements, better access to lower-level primitives to build on top, and experimental extensions to the lightning protocol.


## Highlights for Users

-   Much improved parameter verification in `lightning-cli` makes it easier to debug why a call failed.
-   You can now query for the status of an invoice based on the hash or the invoice.
-   Plugins that are started while the node is running can now receive command line arguments as if they were provided at node startup.
-   The security of the `hsmtool` used to encrypt and decrypt the node's seed key was improved by switching to a passphrase prompt
    instead of a command line argument.
-   Multiple plugins can now register for the `db_write` hook, which means you can now run multiple backup plugins at the same time. In addition we wrote [extensive documentation](https://lightning.readthedocs.io/BACKUP.html) on how to secure your node from dataloss.


## Highlights for the Network

-   No more reckless: the default network changed from `testnet` to `bitcoin`.
-   We have experimental support for the onion messages proposal, allowing arbitrary messages to be exchanged between nodes in the network.
-   We have experimental support for the offers proposal, enabling reusable invoices, refunds, invoices denominated in currencies other than bitcoins, and much much more. If you ever wanted to have an inline communication step with the other endpoint of a payment then take a look at this.

## Highlights for Developers

-   pyln now supports both receiving notifications from the RPC interface, as well as sending notifications in methods implemented by plugins. No more waiting in front of a blank screen for your users.
-   The new `createinvoice` allows you to create an invoice externally, then have your node sign it and manage it internally.
-   You can use `sendonionmessage` to send an onion routed message, which recipient can receive using a plugin that register for the `onion_message` or `onion_message_blinded` hook.

More details can be found in the [changelog](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/v0.9.3/CHANGELOG.md)

Thanks to everyone for their contributions and bug reports; please keep them coming.

Since 0.9.2, we've had 360 commits from 13 different authors over 60 days, an average commit rate of 6.51 commits per day 🤓

A special thanks goes to the 2 first time contributors:

-   João Paulo
-   Karol Hosiawa

Cheers,

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.0-beta.rc6"/>
    <summary>This release marks the first major release in the `v0.12.x` series! As this is a major release several new features are included in this release including: anchor commitment types are now the default, anchor commitment support for watchtowers, new arguments to auto compact the database as well as drop the `wtxmgr` state, generic wallet PSBT crafting+signing, and much more! As usual, this release contains several important bug fixes, so we recommend all users update. 

# Database Migrations
A migration to initialize a top-level peers bucket is included in this release. The bucket is used to track flap counts for peers that we have channels open with across restarts. These values are used to rate-limit the amount of memory that `lnd` uses to track peers online state, ensuring that we do not store large volumes of uptime information for peers that are constantly changing online state.

This release contains a migration to initialize a top-level-bucket for an outpoint index. There is also a subsequent migration that populates this index with an outpoint's status. This will cut down on expensive `bbolt` transactions throughout the codebase. The migration process should look something like this upon initial start up:
```

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.0-beta.rc6.txt.asc` is in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.0-beta.rc6.txt.asc
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Wed Sep 30 17:35:20 2020 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 4AB7F8DA6FAEBB3B70B1F903BC13F65E2DC84465
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.0-beta.rc6.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.0-beta.rc6.txt.asc.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.12.0-beta.rc6.txt.asc
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.15.6`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, and `watchtowerrpc`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.12.0-beta.rc6
gpg: Signature made Tue Sep 15 18:55:00 2020 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 4AB7F8DA6FAEBB3B70B1F903BC13F65E2DC84465
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker pull lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.0-beta.rc6
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.12.0-beta.rc6 /verify-install.sh
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.12.0-beta.rc6.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.12.0-beta.rc6.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.0-beta.rc6&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.0-beta.rc6&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

# Release Notes

## New Default Autopilot Heuristic

[In this version of `lnd`, the default heursitic for autopilot has been changed from preferential attachment, to a version that will attempt to optimize for the betweeness centrality of the node](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4668). At a high level, this change means that rather than trying to connect (stochastically) to the nodes that have the _most_ channels, `lnd` will instead attempt to connect to the nodes that [appear most often in the shortest paths within the network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality). This change will serve to step as a stepping stone to further diffuse the graph to make it more resilient. 

## Pathfinding Improvements 

[`lnd` will now properly penalize attempts of larger &quot;wumbo&quot; sized payments proportionally](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4602). This will serve to ensure that clients with less active failure information are able to properly prune the search space by increasing the _attempt_ cost for larger payments. New flags has been added to allow users to configure the attempt cost for this value (`attemptcost` and `attemptcostppm`). We encourage users taht frequently send larger payments to tweak these parameters to find what works best, and ideally communicate this information back to the maintainers of `lnd` so we can better tune the current default value. 

## Graph Download Optimizations 

[`lnd` will now _batch_ all insertion operations related to channel graph which should _greatly_ speed up initial graph download](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/3367). Initial becnhmarks show this change resluting in a 3x speed increase, with further gains likely being seen on mobile and more constrained platforms. 

## Peer to Peer Updates 

[A new flag has been added to `lnd` to enforce a _global_ connection timeout when trying to connect out to new peers](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4452). Setting a lower value for this new command line option (`timeout`) will mean that `lnd` will give up on unrechable peers much sooner than before, which can be useful when attempting to connect to a set of addresses to open chnnel to a peer. 


## Automatic Database Compaction

The most important data of any `lnd` node is stored in its channel database (`channel.db`). The database library currently used for this DB is `bbolt` which by design does not give back free space to the file system, even if data is deleted from the DB. This can lead to large DB files and slow startup times. Compaction is the process of creating a fresh copy of a `bbolt` database that only contains data and no &quot;reserved free space&quot;. This process also de-fragments and validates the integrity of the data.

[Automatic compaction of the `channel.db` can now be turned on](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4667) with the flag `--db.bolt.auto-compact`. By default this will compact on startup, if the last compaction was more than a week ago. The flag `--db.bolt.auto-compact-min-age` can also be set to `0` to force compaction on every startup, independent of how long ago it happened last.


## Protocol Upgrades

### Anchor Output Channels
`lnd` will now open the new channel type dubbed &quot;anchor channels&quot; by default if both peers support it. You signal support by setting the `--protocol.anchors` flag at `lnd` startup. This is a channel type that has been available to advanced users [since lnd v0.10](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.10.0-beta), but it has seen a few updates that makes it [even safer](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4840) and useful in high fee scenarios, and it is now in line with [a proposed BOLT change](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/824).

The anchor channel type is a new type of channel that is much safer in high fee scenarios, as it allows bumping the fees after the channel has been force closed, instead of making the peers agreeing on a future close fee. This is also a nice UX improvement, as less of the channel capacity needs to go towards the commitment fee reserve, and can instead be used for payments. In addition it allows [bundling multiple HTLC transactions](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4779) together into one, potentially saving on chain fees in force close scenarios.

The commitment transaction still needs to be signed up front with a fee that ensures its mempool acceptance, and this [fee now defaults](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4855) to 10 sat/vbyte. This can be tuned by the `--max-commit-fee-rate-anchors` flag, but this should be used with caution. 

Note that one has to have on-chain funds available in the wallet for fee bumping channel closes for anchor channels. Because of this, a small portion of the wallet balance will be reserved for this purpose, and some on-chain actions that used to be allowed can now be rejected if you have anchor channels open.

### Static Remote Key Feature Bit Required

[This new version of `lnd` now requires channels that use a static remote key, AKA &quot;tweakless commitments&quot;](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4751). This change improves safety and security for users as now when a channel is force closed by the remote party, the funds will go directly to a user control key. Prior versions of  `lnd` have supported this channel type, but `lnd` will now **only** allow this type of channel when making channels with new peer.

Lnd will [waive this requirement](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4847) in the case where it still has legacy channels with a peer. This ensures that lnd can still connect to nodes it has existing channels with, even if they do not understand the feature bit. 

### Improved End to End Payment Security 

The MPP protocol upgrade included a so called &quot;payment address&quot; that improves end-to-end payment security by requiring the sender to include a special nonce in the onion payload specify by the receiver. As intermediate nodes can't guess this secret ahead of time, and it's encrypted in the onion only to the finally receiver, they thwarts a large class of probing and de-anonymization attacks. [This new release of `lnd` will now _require_ this feature bit set in any new invoices it creates](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4752), which means all payments that don't include this new payment secret will be rejected. 


## PSBT Signing

The internal wallet can now [create and sign PSBTs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4389). In combination with the `ListUnspent` RPC this allows RPC users to implement full coin control.
This feature also takes us one step closer to the goal of supporting watch-only on-chain wallets in `lnd` where an online node would only have public keys to track the UTXOs and would delegate the signing to a non-networked `lnd` node that has the private keys, all through using PSBTs.
Read more about the possible use cases and dive into the examples [in our PSBT documentation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/psbt.md).

## Build System

Leveraging the power of GitHub Workflows, we now [automatically build and push docker images](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4769) of all our releases [to Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/lightninglabs). This includes images for `amd64` and [`arm64`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4852).

The distinction between the production `Dockerfile` and the development `dev.Dockerfile` [were made more clear in the documentation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4790).

The release binaries for all OS/architectures are now [also built by a GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4777). The deterministic build system introduced in a previous release allows us to independently build and sign the binaries locally. Signatures of more than just one developer will be added to releases in the future.

The experiential build tag has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4701) for the `assumechanvalid` flag that is used to prevent long rescans for neutrino nodes.

## Continuous Integration

Our continuous integration pipeline, most notably our integration tests, has received a number of improvements and bug fixes making them considerably faster and somewhat more stable:
- An integration test suite running [against a `bitcoind` with the TX index disabled](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4617) was added.
- The ~70 integration tests are now [split into 4 parts and run in parallel](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4655) reducing the execution time by ~50%.
- Log files are only uploaded to termbin.com and file.io [for failed runs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4623) and the `bitcoind` binaries are [extracted from a docker image instead of being downloaded](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4623), shaving off a few more minutes from the total itest execution time.
- The test harness for the `btcd` node used as the mining node [were improved to fix port collisions](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4765) which resulted in flaky tests.
- A check was added that [forces new command line flags to also be documented in the `sample-lnd.conf` file](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4626).
- A new make target [for itest flake hunting](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4756) was added.
- New make targets [for running fuzz tests](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4643) were added.
- Build tags were removed from the integration test files, [allowing the linter to check those as well](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4593).
- The `zpay32` package's `Decode` and `Encode` functions now have [corresponding fuzz tests](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4651) in the `fuzz` package.
- The `brontide` fuzz tests have been [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4640).
- Fuzz testing has been [optimized](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4682) to instruct `gofuzz` to always mutate the input.

## Contract Court Performance Improvements
Performance [improvements](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4697) were made to the contract court subsystem which is responsible for closing out channels on chain and taking on-chain actions required to fully resolve the channel. The number of database transactions required to start up the subsystem has been reduced from one per channel to a single transaction, which reduces startup time. Improvements to the way the subsystem consumes new blocks from its backing bitcoin node have also improved the memory footprint of the system. 

## Extended Health Checks 

[A new optional `healthcheck` has been added to insturct `lnd` to restart itself in order to _refresh_ an expired RPC TLS cert](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4792). This change is useful in containerized contexts such as k8s, where an auto restarting `lnd` is able to propagate any auth changes in a decoupled manner upon restart. 

## `htlcswitch` Enhancements 

Database contention has been [reduced](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4547) in the link by batching removal of forwarding packages. The removal timer has also been increased from 1 minute to 1 hour.

[A bug has been fixed in our non-strict forwarding randomization](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4659) to ensure we explciitly randomize our link sleection rather than relying on the undefined ordering of map interation in the Go spec.

## Gossip Enhancements

During the development of this release, an increase in high disk usage was reported by several users throughout the network due to channel update spam. To minimize the effects to disks, `lnd` will now [rate limit channel updates in two ways](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4786). Keep-alive updates, those which only increase their timestamps to signal liveliness, are now limited to one per rebroadcast interval (current default of 24H). Non-keep-alive updates are now limited to one per block per direction.

As required by the specification, `lnd` now [enforces all channels for a block must fit within a single reply](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4804). It would previously not enforce this as it would allow an overlap of blocks across multiple replies, which could lead other implementations to send us a error due to the overlap and cause connect/disconnect cycles.

`lnd` will [no longer accept premature channel announcements/updates and wait for their maturity](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4895).

## Peer Flap Rate Tracking

An [update](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4440) to the channel fitness subsystem has introduced tracking of the number of times lnd is connected and disconnected from each of its peers. This information is surfaced in the output of the `ListPeers` API. 

The flap rate we have recorded for peers is also used to rate limit the amount of data lnd will store to track the peer’s uptime. If a peer has a high flap rate, lnd will reduce the amount of data it stores in memory, resulting in more aggregated uptime information. This change is intended to protect against constantly flapping peers, and will have little effect on peers that are consistently online with the occasional restart. To ensure that we do not permanently punish a peer for a period of instability long in the past, the flap rate we track for peers is exponentially cooled down over time. 

## RPC Enchancements &amp; Bug Fixes

### GetInfo `best_header_timestamp`

[The `best_header_timestamp` field included in the `GetInfo`'s RPC response will now be set to what the backend reports while it is syncing](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4703). This will restore the ability for higher-level applications to determine their sync progress.

### Watchtower Address Removal

[The last address of a registered watchtower can no longer be removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4746) to prevent a potential panic. 

### Uniform Unconfirmed Coin Selection for SendCoins+

[`lnd` now allows all RPC calls that craft and send transactions to spend unconfirmed coins](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4653). 

This change the following RPCs:

- `Lightning.SendCoins`
- `Lightning.SendMany`
- `WalletKit.SendOutputs`

We've added two new parameters for these methods, following the same format as used for `Lightning.OpenChannel` RPC:

- `min_confs` (default=1)
- `spend_unconfirmed` (default=false)


### Macaroon Root ID Key Rotation 

[`lnd` now supports _root ID_ key rotation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4427). This allows the baker (creator) of a set of macaroons to _invalidate_ them all by deleting and regenerating the root key used to generate the macaroons. This feature is a useful security tool, as if an application/system that uses lnd's macaroons in a fine grained manner is compromised, the admin is able to _revoke_ all generated macaroons. 

Several new calls have been added to allow users to take advantage of this feature, namely:
  * The `lncli bakemacaroon` call now accepts a new parameter: `root_key_id`. This new field is an integer that can be used to rotate root ID keys. 
  * A new `lncli listmacaroonids` command has been added to allow callers to monitor all their existing allocated root IDs.
  * A new `lncli deletemacaroonid` call has been added which implements _macaroon revocation_ by allowing the caller to _delete_ a specified root key ID. 
 
 
### New Verbose Output for `ChannelBalance`

[The `lncli channebalance` call now returns much more information than before in order to give users more insight w.r.t exactly _how_ their funds are distributed off-chain](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4512). An output of the new call resmbles the following: 
```
⛰lncli channelbalance
{
    &quot;balance&quot;: &quot;27476201&quot;,
    &quot;pending_open_balance&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
    &quot;local_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;27476201&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;27476201135&quot;
    },
    &quot;remote_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;109137173&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;109137173865&quot;
    },
    &quot;unsettled_local_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;
    },
    &quot;unsettled_remote_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;
    },
    &quot;pending_open_local_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;
    },
    &quot;pending_open_remote_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;1783362&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;1783362000&quot;
    }
}
```

Note that the first two fields (`balance` and `pending_open_balance`) are now deprecated and will be _removed_ in the future. Callers should use the new fields that return both `sat` and `msat` instead. 

### Raw Key Support for `SharedKeyRequest`

[The `DeriveSharedKey` now accepts a raw public key in addition to key locator](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4436). 

### Additional HTLC Information in ListChannels

[The `ListChannels` call will now return additional information about the set of linked HTLCs in a channel](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4693). Namely, we'll now return: 
  * The `htlc_index` of the HTLC within the channel 
  * The `forwarding_channel`, or the channel that forwarded the HTLC to the targte channel 
  * The `forwarding_htlc_index`, or the HTLC index on the forwarded channel. 

### Automated Let's Encrypt Certificates 

A new series of command line flags have been added to `lnd` which allows users to automatically obtain and renew a Let's Encrypt Certificate for the RPC interface of their `lnd` node. With this change, in certain configurations, callers will be able to hit an `lnd` now without having to manually store and update the `tls.cert` locally. 
New flags added to the `lnd` command line and `lnd.conf`:

* `--letsencryptport`: The port on which lnd will listen for Let's Encrypt challenges. Let's Encrypt will always try to contact on port 80. Often non-root processes are not allowed to bind to ports lower than 1024. This configuration option allows a different port to be used, but must be used in combination with port forwarding from port 80.
* `--letsencryptdir`: The directory to store Let's Encrypt certificates within. By default this is `.lnd/letsencrypt`.
* `--letsencryptdomain`: Request a Let's Encrypt certificate for the domain specified using this flag.

When `lncli` cannot find a `tls.cert` file, it will assume the server has a valid (Let's Encrypt) certificate. It is important to pass the domain name as a command line flag to `lncli`:

`lncli --rpcserver my.domain.org:10009`

This is necessary as well when connecting to `localhost`.

### Custom Routing Hints for AddHoldInvoice 

[The `AddHoldInvoice` RPC call now allows the users to specify their own custom routing hints](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/3672). 



### Allow No RPC Auth on Private Addresses 

[A new config evaluation has been added to allow user to instruct `lnd` that it should allow RPC requests with no authentiation _only_ if `lnd` is listening on a private address](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4473). This makes certain Docker based configurations more user friendly, as any dependent containers no longer need to obtain and update lnd's RPC authentication information. Assuming `lnd` is only listening on a non-public private interface, then the `--no-macaroons` config option is now valid.  

### New Channel Acceptor Parameters
Additional [fields](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4683) have been added to the `ChannelAcceptor` API, which allow custom setting of custom errors for the remote peer, an upfront shutdown address for the channel (if supported by the peer), and more. Note that the error provided will be sent to the peer verbatim, so should not contain sensitive information.

### Maximum Local CSV
When opening a channel, the remote party can specify the CSV delay for your funds. This value determines the amount of time that your balance will be unavailable in the case where your force close the channel. A [`max_local_csv` parameter](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4735) has been added to allow setting of custom limitations on this value. For outgoing channels, this can be set using the `max_local_csv` field in the `OpenChannel` request. The `maxlocaldelay` config value can be used to set a default maximum value for all channels.

### Disable TLS for REST
It is now possible to [disable TLS for REST RPC](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4648) using `--no-rest-tls`.

## Refactoring
This release sees the removal of several components from the main `lnd` package:
- `fundingmanager.go` and tests are [moved](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4757) to the `funding` package.
- `chainregistry.go` and `chainparams.go` have been [moved](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4487) to the `chainreg` package.
- `mock.go` has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4542) in favor of the `lntest/mock` package.
- A global variable `activeNetParams` has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4505).

The `peer` package's dependency on `brontide` has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4645).
## Miscellaneous

The DNS servers to use for initial peer bootstrapping [can now be specified](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4744) to overwrite the hard coded default values.

All supported command line flags are now [also properly documented in the `sample-lnd.conf` file](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4626).

[A new flag has been added to instruct `lnd` to timeout early if it can't obtain the file lock on bolt DB](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4787). 

### Multi node management

Hosting nodes on non-trusted (cloud) hardware was made safer by adding a [stateless initialization mode](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/1288) that instructs `lnd` to not store any unencrypted macaroons on the host's file system. Instead, the admin macaroon is returned in the response of the wallet creation request and must be stored by the caller.

To support the stateless initialization mode mentioned above on the client side as well, [configuration profiles for `lncli` can now be created](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4310). Those profiles make it easy to interact with multiple nodes from the same client machine. For additional security the macaroons stored in the profiles can optionally be encrypted with a password.

### Recovery

Forcing the on-chain wallet to rescan its state from chain was [made easier by adding the `--reset-wallet-transactions` flag](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4715) to `lnd` that replaces the functionality previously only available in the external tool `dropwtxmgr`.

### Individual subsystem log levels
A change that makes it possible to set the [log level for individual subsystems](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4772) was merged. One can now specify a global log level, and subsystem log levels that will override the global setting: `--debuglevel=debug,PEER=info,SRVR=trace`.


## Bug fixes

- A bug in [the restore logic for old SCB files](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4865) was fixed that caused the `a height hint greater than 0 must be provided` error.
- A bug was fixed in how we [watch for states on chain](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4780), that could cause us to ignore our own close transaction if we attempted recovery while our force close transaction was still in the mempool.
- All directories referenced by command line flags are [now properly created](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4622) on startup.
- Neutrino users can now [specify a full node backend with an Onion v2 address](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4806). Before this fix, only clearnet addresses were supported.
- The chain backend health check which ensures that lnd is reliably connected to a bitcoin node has been [updated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4755) to use the `uptime` api for bitcoind nodes. This check previously used the `getBlockChainInfo` API, which proved unsuitable because it could take up to 5 minutes for bitcoind to respond due to non-granular locking in core.
- A bug in the `walletrpc` subserver’s `ListSweeps` endpoint where the `verbose` output option would fail if a sweep was not found on chain has been [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4762). This could happen for transactions that were replaced-by-fee. 
- [`lnd` will no longer allow restoted channels to be manually closed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4525). This fixes a class of issues that would cause `lnd` to be unable to start due to a borked local channel state. 
- [`lnd` will no longer attempt to trap SIGABRT](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4627). 
- [A bug has been fixed related to mnemonic seed validation on restore](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4738). This ensures `lnd` will properly catch invalid words (that aren't in the wordlist) much earlier than before. 
- [All errors in the `routerrpc` server will now be properly mapped to gRPC status codes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4691). 
- [`lnd` nodes using the neutrino backend will now properly be able to connect to onion v2 onion service addresses](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4806). 
- [A bug preventing the `wtclient` from shutting down cleanly while a concurrent session negotiation is in progress has been fixed.](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4789)

### Installation

Installation instructions are [available on the README](https://github.com/bwt-dev/bwt#installation).

### Verifying signatures

The releases are signed by Nadav Ivgi (@shesek). The public key can be verified on the [PGP WoT](http://keys.gnupg.net/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;fingerprint=on&amp;search=0x81F6104CD0F150FC),
[github](https://api.github.com/users/shesek/gpg_keys), [twitter](https://twitter.com/shesek), [keybase](https://keybase.io/nadav), [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nadaviv) and [this video presentation](https://youtu.be/SXJaN2T3M10?t=4).

```bash
# Download (change x86_64-linux to your platform)
$ wget https://github.com/bwt-dev/bwt/releases/download/v0.2.1/bwt-0.2.1-x86_64-linux.tar.gz

# Fetch public key
$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys FCF19B67866562F08A43AAD681F6104CD0F150FC

# Verify signature
$ wget -qO - https://github.com/bwt-dev/bwt/releases/download/v0.2.1/SHA256SUMS.asc \
  | gpg --decrypt - | grep ' bwt-0.2.1-x86_64-linux.tar.gz$' | sha256sum -c -

$ tar zxvf bwt-0.2.1-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
$ ./bwt-0.1.5-x86_64-linux/bwt --xpub &lt;xpub&gt; ...
```

The signature verification should show `Good signature from &quot;Nadav Ivgi &lt;nadav@shesek.info&gt;&quot; ... Primary key fingerprint: FCF1 9B67 ...` and `bwt-0.2.1-x86_64-linux.tar.gz: OK`.

### Reproducible builds

The builds are fully reproducible.

You can verify the checksums against the v0.2.1 builds on Travis CI: https://travis-ci.org/github/bwt-dev/bwt/builds/754451937

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.0-beta.rc3"/>
    <summary>This release marks the first major release in the `v0.12.x` series! As this is a major release several new features are included in this release including: anchor commitment types are now the default, anchor commitment support for watchtowers, new arguments to auto compact the database as well as drop the `wtxmgr` state, generic wallet PSBT crafting+signing, and much more! As usual, this release contains several important bug fixes, so we recommend all users update. 

# Database Migrations
A migration to initialize a top-level peers bucket is included in this release. The bucket is used to track flap counts for peers that we have channels open with across restarts. These values are used to rate-limit the amount of memory that `lnd` uses to track peers online state, ensuring that we do not store large volumes of uptime information for peers that are constantly changing online state.

This release contains a migration to initialize a top-level-bucket for an outpoint index. There is also a subsequent migration that populates this index with an outpoint's status. This will cut down on expensive `bbolt` transactions throughout the codebase. The migration process should look something like this upon initial start up:
```

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc3.txt` and `manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc3.txt.sig` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc3.txt.sig
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: assuming signed data in 'manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc3.txt'
gpg: Signature made Tue Dec 15 18:57:27 2020 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.


For this release roasbeef's signature is the secondary signature which can be verified with the following command: 
```
gpg --verify roasbeef-manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc3.txt.sig manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc3.txt
gpg: Signature made Wed Sep 30 17:35:20 2020 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 4AB7F8DA6FAEBB3B70B1F903BC13F65E2DC84465
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition to time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: `manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc3.txt.sig.ots` and `manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc3.txt.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc3.txt.ots
ots verify manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc3.txt.sig.ots -f roasbeef-manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc3.txt.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.15.6`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, and `watchtowerrpc`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.12.0-beta.rc3
gpg: Signature made Tue 15 Dec 2020 10:31:06 PM UTC using RSA key ID 9B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot;
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.12.0-beta.rc3.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.12.0-beta.rc3.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.0-beta.rc3&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.0-beta.rc3&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

# Release Notes

## New Default Autopilot Heuristic

[In this version of `lnd`, the default heursitic for autopilot has been changed from preferential attachment, to a version that will attempt to optimize for the betweeness centrality of the node](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4668). At a high level, this change means that rather than trying to connect (stochastically) to the nodes that have the _most_ channels, `lnd` will instead attempt to connect to the nodes that [appear most often in the shortest paths within the network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality). This change will serve to step as a stepping stone to further diffuse the graph to make it more resilient. 

## Pathfinding Improvements 

[`lnd` will now properly penalize attempts of larger &quot;wumbo&quot; sized payments proportionally](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4602). This will serve to ensure that clients with less active failure information are able to properly prune the search space by increasing the _attempt_ cost for larger payments. New flags has been added to allow users to configure the attempt cost for this value (`attemptcost` and `attemptcostppm`). We encourage users taht frequently send larger payments to tweak these parameters to find what works best, and ideally communicate this information back to the maintainers of `lnd` so we can better tune the current default value. 

## Graph Download Optimizations 

[`lnd` will now _batch_ all insertion operations related to channel graph which should _greatly_ speed up initial graph download](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/3367). Initial becnhmarks show this change resluting in a 3x speed increase, with further gains likely being seen on mobile and more constrained platforms. 

## Peer to Peer Updates 

[A new flag has been added to `lnd` to enforce a _global_ connection timeout when trying to connect out to new peers](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4452). Setting a lower value for this new command line option (`timeout`) will mean that `lnd` will give up on unrechable peers much sooner than before, which can be useful when attempting to connect to a set of addresses to open chnnel to a peer. 


## Automatic Database Compaction

The most important data of any `lnd` node is stored in its channel database (`channel.db`). The database library currently used for this DB is `bbolt` which by design does not give back free space to the file system, even if data is deleted from the DB. This can lead to large DB files and slow startup times. Compaction is the process of creating a fresh copy of a `bbolt` database that only contains data and no &quot;reserved free space&quot;. This process also de-fragments and validates the integrity of the data.

[Automatic compaction of the `channel.db` can now be turned on](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4667) with the flag `--db.bolt.auto-compact`. By default this will compact on startup, if the last compaction was more than a week ago. The flag `--db.bolt.auto-compact-min-age` can also be set to `0` to force compaction on every startup, independent of how long ago it happened last.


## Protocol Upgrades

### Anchor Output Channels
`lnd` will now open the new channel type dubbed &quot;anchor channels&quot; by default if both peers support it. This is a channel type that has been available to advanced users [since lnd v0.10](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.10.0-beta), but it has seen a few updates that makes it [even safer](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4840) and useful in high fee scenarios, and it is now in line with [a proposed BOLT change](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/824).

The anchor channel type is a new type of channel that is much safer in high fee scenarios, as it allows bumping the fees after the channel has been force closed, instead of making the peers agreeing on a future close fee. This is also a nice UX improvement, as less of the channel capacity needs to go towards the commitment fee reserve, and can instead be used for payments. In addition it allows [bundling multiple HTLC transactions](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4779) together into one, potentially saving on chain fees in force close scenarios.

The commitment transaction still needs to be signed up front with a fee that ensures its mempool acceptance, and this [fee now defaults](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4855) to 10 sat/vbyte. This can be tuned by the `--max-commit-fee-rate-anchors` flag, but this should be used with caution. One can opt-out of the anchor channel type for new channels by setting the `--protocol.no-anchors` flag.

### Static Remote Key Feature Bit Required

[This new version of `lnd` now requires channels that use a static remote key,
AKA &quot;tweakless commitments&quot;](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4751). This change
improves safety and security for users as now when a channel is force closed by
the remote party, the funds will go directly to a user control key. Prior
versions of  `lnd` have supported this channel type, but `lnd` will now
**only** allow this type of channel when making channels with new peer.

Lnd will [waive this requirement](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4847) in the case where it still has legacy channels with a peer. This ensures that lnd can still
connect to nodes it has existing channels with, even if they do not understand
the feature bit. 

### Improved End to End Payment Security 

The MPP protocol upgrade included a so called &quot;payment address&quot; that improves
end-to-end payment security by requiring the sender to include a special nonce
in the onion payload specify by the receiver. As intermediate nodes can't guess
this secret ahead of time, and it's encrypted in the onion only to the finally
receiver, they thwarts a large class of probing and de-anonymization attacks.
[This new release of `lnd` will now _require_ this feature bit set in any new
invoices it creates](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4752), which
means all payments that don't include this new payment secret will be rejected. 


## PSBT Signing

The internal wallet can now [create and sign PSBTs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4389). In combination with the `ListUnspent` RPC this allows RPC users to implement full coin control.
This feature also takes us one step closer to the goal of supporting watch-only on-chain wallets in `lnd` where an online node would only have public keys to track the UTXOs and would delegate the signing to a non-networked `lnd` node that has the private keys, all through using PSBTs.
Read more about the possible use cases and dive into the examples [in our PSBT documentation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/psbt.md).

## Build System

Leveraging the power of GitHub Workflows, we now [automatically build and push docker images](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4769) of all our releases [to Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/lightninglabs). This includes images for `amd64` and [`arm64`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4852).

The distinction between the production `Dockerfile` and the development `dev.Dockerfile` [were made more clear in the documentation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4790).

The release binaries for all OS/architectures are now [also built by a GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4777). The deterministic build system introduced in a previous release allows us to independently build and sign the binaries locally. Signatures of more than just one developer will be added to releases in the future.

The experiential build tag has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4701) for the `assumechanvalid` flag that is used to prevent long rescans for neutrino nodes.

## Continuous Integration

Our continuous integration pipeline, most notably our integration tests, has received a number of improvements and bug fixes making them considerably faster and somewhat more stable:
- An integration test suite running [against a `bitcoind` with the TX index disabled](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4617) was added.
- The ~70 integration tests are now [split into 4 parts and run in parallel](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4655) reducing the execution time by ~50%.
- Log files are only uploaded to termbin.com and file.io [for failed runs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4623) and the `bitcoind` binaries are [extracted from a docker image instead of being downloaded](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4623), shaving off a few more minutes from the total itest execution time.
- The test harness for the `btcd` node used as the mining node [were improved to fix port collisions](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4765) which resulted in flaky tests.
- A check was added that [forces new command line flags to also be documented in the `sample-lnd.conf` file](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4626).
- A new make target [for itest flake hunting](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4756) was added.
- New make targets [for running fuzz tests](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4643) were added.
- Build tags were removed from the integration test files, [allowing the linter to check those as well](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4593).
- The `zpay32` package's `Decode` and `Encode` functions now have [corresponding fuzz tests](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4651) in the `fuzz` package.
- The `brontide` fuzz tests have been [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4640).
- Fuzz testing has been [optimized](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4682) to instruct `gofuzz` to always mutate the input.

## Contract Court Performance Improvements
Performance [improvements](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4697) were made to the contract court subsystem which is responsible for closing out channels on chain and taking on-chain actions required to fully resolve the channel. The number of database transactions required to start up the subsystem has been reduced from one per channel to a single transaction, which reduces startup time. Improvements to the way the subsystem consumes new blocks from its backing bitcoin node have also improved the memory footprint of the system. 

## Extended Health Checks 

[A new optional `healthcheck` has been added to insturct `lnd` to restart itself in order to _refresh_ an expired RPC TLS cert](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4792). This change is useful in containerized contexts such as k8s, where an auto restarting `lnd` is able to propagate any auth changes in a decoupled manner upon restart. 

## `htlcswitch` Enhancements 

Database contention has been [reduced](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4547) in the link by batching removal of forwarding packages. The removal timer has also been increased from 1 minute to 1 hour.

[A bug has been fixed in our non-strict forwarding randomization](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4659) to ensure we explciitly randomize our link sleection rather than relying on the undefined ordering of map interation in the Go spec. 

## Peer Flap Rate Tracking

An [update](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4440) to the channel fitness subsystem has introduced tracking of the number of times lnd is connected and disconnected from each of its peers. This information is surfaced in the output of the `ListPeers` API. 

The flap rate we have recorded for peers is also used to rate limit the amount of data lnd will store to track the peer’s uptime. If a peer has a high flap rate, lnd will reduce the amount of data it stores in memory, resulting in more aggregated uptime information. This change is intended to protect against constantly flapping peers, and will have little effect on peers that are consistently online with the occasional restart. To ensure that we do not permanently punish a peer for a period of instability long in the past, the flap rate we track for peers is exponentially cooled down over time. 

## RPC Enchancements &amp; Bug Fixes 

### Uniform Unconfirmed Coin Selection for SendCoins+

[`lnd` now allows all RPC calls that craft and send transactions to spend unconfirmed coins](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4653). 

This change the following RPCs:

- `Lightning.SendCoins`
- `Lightning.SendMany`
- `WalletKit.SendOutputs`

We've added two new parameters for these methods, following the same format as used for `Lightning.OpenChannel` RPC:

- `min_confs` (default=1)
- `spend_unconfirmed` (default=false)


### Macaroon Root ID Key Rotation 

[`lnd` now supports _root ID_ key rotation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4427). This allows the baker (creator) of a set of macaroons to _invalidate_ them all by deleting and regenerating the root key used to generate the macaroons. This feature is a useful security tool, as if an application/system that uses lnd's macaroons in a fine grained manner is compromised, the admin is able to _revoke_ all generated macaroons. 

Several new calls have been added to allow users to take advantage of this feature, namely:
  * The `lncli bakemacaroon` call now accepts a new parameter: `root_key_id`. This new field is an integer that can be used to rotate root ID keys. 
  * A new `lncli listmacaroonids` command has been added to allow callers to monitor all their existing allocated root IDs.
  * A new `lncli deletemacaroonid` call has been added which implements _macaroon revocation_ by allowing the caller to _delete_ a specified root key ID. 
 
 
### New Verbose Output for `ChannelBalance`

[The `lncli channebalance` call now returns much more information than before in order to give users more insight w.r.t exactly _how_ their funds are distributed off-chain](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4512). An output of the new call resmbles the following: 
```
⛰lncli channelbalance
{
    &quot;balance&quot;: &quot;27476201&quot;,
    &quot;pending_open_balance&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
    &quot;local_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;27476201&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;27476201135&quot;
    },
    &quot;remote_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;109137173&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;109137173865&quot;
    },
    &quot;unsettled_local_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;
    },
    &quot;unsettled_remote_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;
    },
    &quot;pending_open_local_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;
    },
    &quot;pending_open_remote_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;1783362&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;1783362000&quot;
    }
}
```

Note that the first two fields (`balance` and `pending_open_balance`) are now deprecated and will be _removed_ in the future. Callers should use the new fields that return both `sat` and `msat` instead. 

### Raw Key Support for `SharedKeyRequest`

[The `DeriveSharedKey` now accepts a raw public key in addition to key locator](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4436). 

### Additional HTLC Information in ListChannels

[The `ListChannels` call will now return additional information about the set of linked HTLCs in a channel](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4693). Namely, we'll now return: 
  * The `htlc_index` of the HTLC within the channel 
  * The `forwarding_channel`, or the channel that forwarded the HTLC to the targte channel 
  * The `forwarding_htlc_index`, or the HTLC index on the forwarded channel. 

### Automated Let's Encrypt Certificates 

A new series of command line flags have been added to `lnd` which allows users to automatically obtain and renew a Let's Encrypt Certificate for the RPC interface of their `lnd` node. With this change, in certain configurations, callers will be able to hit an `lnd` now without having to manually store and update the `tls.cert` locally. 
New flags added to the `lnd` command line and `lnd.conf`:

* `--letsencryptport`: The port on which lnd will listen for Let's Encrypt challenges. Let's Encrypt will always try to contact on port 80. Often non-root processes are not allowed to bind to ports lower than 1024. This configuration option allows a different port to be used, but must be used in combination with port forwarding from port 80.
* `--letsencryptdir`: The directory to store Let's Encrypt certificates within. By default this is `.lnd/letsencrypt`.
* `--letsencryptdomain`: Request a Let's Encrypt certificate for the domain specified using this flag.

When `lncli` cannot find a `tls.cert` file, it will assume the server has a valid (Let's Encrypt) certificate. It is important to pass the domain name as a command line flag to `lncli`:

`lncli --rpcserver my.domain.org:10009`

This is necessary as well when connecting to `localhost`.

### Custom Routing Hints for AddHoldInvoice 

[The `AddHoldInvoice` RPC call now allows the users to specify their own custom routing hints](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/3672). 



### Allow No RPC Auth on Private Addresses 

[A new config evaluation has been added to allow user to instruct `lnd` that it should allow RPC requests with no authentiation _only_ if `lnd` is listening on a private address](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4473). This makes certain Docker based configurations more user friendly, as any dependent containers no longer need to obtain and update lnd's RPC authentication information. Assuming `lnd` is only listening on a non-public private interface, then the `--no-macaroons` config option is now valid.  

### New Channel Acceptor Parameters
Additional [fields](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4683) have been added to the `ChannelAcceptor` API, which allow custom setting of custom errors for the remote peer, an upfront shutdown address for the channel (if supported by the peer), and more. Note that the error provided will be sent to the peer verbatim, so should not contain sensitive information.

### Maximum Local CSV
When opening a channel, the remote party can specify the CSV delay for your funds. This value determines the amount of time that your balance will be unavailable in the case where your force close the channel. A [`max_local_csv` parameter](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4735) has been added to allow setting of custom limitations on this value. For outgoing channels, this can be set using the `max_local_csv` field in the `OpenChannel` request. The `maxlocaldelay` config value can be used to set a default maximum value for all channels.

### Disable TLS for REST
It is now possible to [disable TLS for REST RPC](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4648) using `--no-rest-tls`.

## Refactoring
This release sees the removal of several components from the main `lnd` package:
- `fundingmanager.go` and tests are [moved](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4757) to the `funding` package.
- `chainregistry.go` and `chainparams.go` have been [moved](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4487) to the `chainreg` package.
- `mock.go` has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4542) in favor of the `lntest/mock` package.
- A global variable `activeNetParams` has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4505).

The `peer` package's dependency on `brontide` has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4645).
## Miscellaneous

The DNS servers to use for initial peer bootstrapping [can now be specified](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4744) to overwrite the hard coded default values.

All supported command line flags are now [also properly documented in the `sample-lnd.conf` file](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4626).

[A new flag has been added to instruct `lnd` to timeout early if it can't obtain the file lock on bolt DB](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4787). 

### Multi node management

Hosting nodes on non-trusted (cloud) hardware was made safer by adding a [stateless initialization mode](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/1288) that instructs `lnd` to not store any unencrypted macaroons on the host's file system. Instead, the admin macaroon is returned in the response of the wallet creation request and must be stored by the caller.

To support the stateless initialization mode mentioned above on the client side as well, [configuration profiles for `lncli` can now be created](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4310). Those profiles make it easy to interact with multiple nodes from the same client machine. For additional security the macaroons stored in the profiles can optionally be encrypted with a password.

### Recovery

Forcing the on-chain wallet to rescan its state from chain was [made easier by adding the `--reset-wallet-transactions` flag](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4715) to `lnd` that replaces the functionality previously only available in the external tool `dropwtxmgr`.

### Individual subsystem log levels
A change that makes it possible to set the [log level for individual subsystems](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4772) was merged. One can now specify a global log level, and subsystem log levels that will override the global setting: `--debuglevel=debug,PEER=info,SRVR=trace`.


## Bug fixes

- A bug in [the restore logic for old SCB files](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4865) was fixed that caused the `a height hint greater than 0 must be provided` error.
- A bug was fixed in how we [watch for states on chain](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4780), that could cause us to ignore our own close transaction if we attempted recovery while our force close transaction was still in the mempool.
- All directories referenced by command line flags are [now properly created](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4622) on startup.
- Neutrino users can now [specify a full node backend with an Onion v2 address](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4806). Before this fix, only clearnet addresses were supported.
- The chain backend health check which ensures that lnd is reliably connected to a bitcoin node has been [updated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4755) to use the `uptime` api for bitcoind nodes. This check previously used the `getBlockChainInfo` API, which proved unsuitable because it could take up to 5 minutes for bitcoind to respond due to non-granular locking in core.
- A bug in the `walletrpc` subserver’s `ListSweeps` endpoint where the `verbose` output option would fail if a sweep was not found on chain has been [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4762). This could happen for transactions that were replaced-by-fee. 
- [`lnd` will no longer allow restoted channels to be manually closed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4525). This fixes a class of issues that would cause `lnd` to be unable to start due to a borked local channel state. 
- [`lnd` will no longer attempt to trap SIGABRT](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4627). 
- [A bug has been fixed related to mnemonic seed validation on restore](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4738). This ensures `lnd` will properly catch invalid words (that aren't in the wordlist) much earlier than before. 
- [All errors in the `routerrpc` server will now be properly mapped to gRPC status codes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4691). 
- [`lnd` nodes using the neutrino backend will now properly be able to connect to onion v2 onion service addresses](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4806).

### Assets
No new assets.

## Verification

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.5.4.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
`shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/Java/Bisq-1.5.4.jar`
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.5.4.jar.txt file.


## Known issues with installation 

### macOS Catalina:

&gt; Bisq can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

This happens the first time Bisq is run on macOS Catalina. It is because a new security feature in Catalina has newer requirements of how apps are packaged. We are working on ways to address this (see #3402 and #4196 for details).

Workaround: Right click on the installed Bisq app &gt; Click `Open` (warning popup shown again, but with new button available) &gt; Click `Open`

&gt; Bisq would like to receive keystrokes from any application.

Discussed in issue https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373, you will see a permission request in the latest macOS version that Bisq wants to receive keystrokes from any application. Unfortunately that is an issue for all Java applications that are run on Catalina right now. We are investigating already how to solve this issue and will fix in one of our next updates.

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/Bisq/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.5.4.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it. 

## Cleanup tool for saved trades that failed market price check

With this release we are also shipping a cleanup tool (Bisq-cleanup-trades*). It will remove corrupt trade entries added due to bug https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/2924. Install and run once, it will shut down automatically, then install version 1.5.4 or later. You can verify the binary the same way as you do with the Bisq application.

Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.5.3.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
`shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/Java/Bisq-1.5.3.jar`
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.5.3.jar.txt file.


## Known issues with installation 

### macOS Catalina:

&gt; Bisq can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

This happens the first time Bisq is run on macOS Catalina. It is because a new security feature in Catalina has newer requirements of how apps are packaged. We are working on ways to address this (see #3402 and #4196 for details).

Workaround: Right click on the installed Bisq app &gt; Click `Open` (warning popup shown again, but with new button available) &gt; Click `Open`

&gt; Bisq would like to receive keystrokes from any application.

Discussed in issue https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373, you will see a permission request in the latest macOS version that Bisq wants to receive keystrokes from any application. Unfortunately that is an issue for all Java applications that are run on Catalina right now. We are investigating already how to solve this issue and will fix in one of our next updates.

### Windows:

~The binary of this version is not signed by a code signing certificate right now as it was in previous versions. This is because of an expired certificate that wasn't renewed in-time. It will be signed on 28th of Dec with the newly received certificate and this note will be removed afterwards.~ The Windows binary was signed on Dec 27th and uploaded together with an updated signature file.

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/Bisq/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.5.3.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it. 

## Cleanup tool for saved trades that failed market price check

With this release we are also shipping a cleanup tool (Bisq-cleanup-trades*). It will remove corrupt trade entries added due to bug https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/2924. Install and run once, it will shut down automatically, then install version 1.5.3 or later. You can verify the binary the same way as you do with the Bisq application.

# Database Migrations
- TODO: describe &quot;peers-bucket&quot;

This release contains a migration to initialize a top-level-bucket for an outpoint index. There is also a subsequent migration that populates this index with an outpoint's status. This will cut down on expensive `bbolt` transactions throughout the codebase. The migration process should look something like this upon initial start up:
```

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc2.txt` and `manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc2.txt.sig` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc2.txt.sig
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: assuming signed data in 'manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc2.txt'
gpg: Signature made Tue Dec 15 18:57:27 2020 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.


For this release roasbeef's signature is the secondary signature which can be verified with the following command: 
```
gpg --verify roasbeef-manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc2.txt.sig manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc2.txt
gpg: Signature made Wed Sep 30 17:35:20 2020 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 4AB7F8DA6FAEBB3B70B1F903BC13F65E2DC84465
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition to time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: `manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc2.txt.sig.ots` and `manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc2.txt.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc2.txt.ots
ots verify manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc2.txt.sig.ots -f roasbeef-manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc2.txt.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.15.6`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, and `watchtowerrpc`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.12.0-beta.rc2
gpg: Signature made Tue 15 Dec 2020 10:31:06 PM UTC using RSA key ID 9B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot;
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.12.0-beta.rc2.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.12.0-beta.rc2.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.0-beta.rc2&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.0-beta.rc2&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

# Release Notes

## New Default Autopilot Heuristic

[In this version of `lnd`, the default heursitic for autopilot has been changed from preferential attachment, to a version that will attempt to optimize for the betweeness centrality of the node](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4668). At a high level, this change means that rather than trying to connect (stochastically) to the nodes that have the _most_ channels, `lnd` will instead attempt to connect to the nodes that [appear most often in the shortest paths within the network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality). This change will serve to step as a stepping stone to further diffuse the graph to make it more resilient. 

## Pathfinding Improvements 

[`lnd` will now properly penalize attempts of larger &quot;wumbo&quot; sized payments proportionally](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4602). This will serve to ensure that clients with less active failure information are able to properly prune the search space by increasing the _attempt_ cost for larger payments. New flags has been added to allow users to configure the attempt cost for this value (`attemptcost` and `attemptcostppm`). We encourage users taht frequently send larger payments to tweak these parameters to find what works best, and ideally communicate this information back to the maintainers of `lnd` so we can better tune the current default value. 

## Graph Download Optimizations 

[`lnd` will now _batch_ all insertion operations related to channel graph which should _greatly_ speed up initial graph download](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/3367). Initial becnhmarks show this change resluting in a 3x speed increase, with further gains likely being seen on mobile and more constrained platforms. 

## Peer to Peer Updates 

[A new flag has been added to `lnd` to enforce a _global_ connection timeout when trying to connect out to new peers](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4452). Setting a lower value for this new command line option (`timeout`) will mean that `lnd` will give up on unrechable peers much sooner than before, which can be useful when attempting to connect to a set of addresses to open chnnel to a peer. 


## Automatic Database Compaction

The most important data of any `lnd` node is stored in its channel database (`channel.db`). The database library currently used for this DB is `bbolt` which by design does not give back free space to the file system, even if data is deleted from the DB. This can lead to large DB files and slow startup times. Compaction is the process of creating a fresh copy of a `bbolt` database that only contains data and no &quot;reserved free space&quot;. This process also de-fragments and validates the integrity of the data.

[Automatic compaction of the `channel.db` can now be turned on](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4667) with the flag `--db.bolt.auto-compact`. By default this will compact on startup, if the last compaction was more than a week ago. The flag `--db.bolt.auto-compact-min-age` can also be set to `0` to force compaction on every startup, independent of how long ago it happened last.


## Protocol Upgrades

### Anchor Output Channels
`lnd` will now open the new channel type dubbed &quot;anchor channels&quot; by default if both peers support it. This is a channel type that has been available to advanced users [since lnd v0.10](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.10.0-beta), but it has seen a few updates that makes it [even safer](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4840) and useful in high fee scenarios, and it is now in line with [a proposed BOLT change](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/824).

The anchor channel type is a new type of channel that is much safer in high fee scenarios, as it allows bumping the fees after the channel has been force closed, instead of making the peers agreeing on a future close fee. This is also a nice UX improvement, as less of the channel capacity needs to go towards the commitment fee reserve, and can instead be used for payments. In addition it allows [bundling multiple HTLC transactions](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4779) together into one, potentially saving on chain fees in force close scenarios.

The commitment transaction still needs to be signed up front with a fee that ensures its mempool acceptance, and this [fee now defaults](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4855) to 10 sat/vbyte. This can be tuned by the `--max-commit-fee-rate-anchors` flag, but this should be used with caution. One can opt-out of the anchor channel type for new channels by setting the `--protocol.no-anchors` flag.

### Static Remote Key Feature Bit Required

[This new version of `lnd` now requires channels that use a static remote key,
AKA &quot;tweakless commitments&quot;](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4751). This change
improves safety and security for users as now when a channel is force closed by
the remote party, the funds will go directly to a user control key. Prior
versions of  `lnd` have supported this channel type, but `lnd` will now
**only** allow this type of channel when making channels with new peer.

Lnd will [waive this requirement](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4847) in the case where it still has legacy channels with a peer. This ensures that lnd can still
connect to nodes it has existing channels with, even if they do not understand
the feature bit. 

### Improved End to End Payment Security 

The MPP protocol upgrade included a so called &quot;payment address&quot; that improves
end-to-end payment security by requiring the sender to include a special nonce
in the onion payload specify by the receiver. As intermediate nodes can't guess
this secret ahead of time, and it's encrypted in the onion only to the finally
receiver, they thwarts a large class of probing and de-anonymization attacks.
[This new release of `lnd` will now _require_ this feature bit set in any new
invoices it creates](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4752), which
means all payments that don't include this new payment secret will be rejected. 


## PSBT Signing

The internal wallet can now [create and sign PSBTs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4389). In combination with the `ListUnspent` RPC this allows RPC users to implement full coin control.
This feature also takes us one step closer to the goal of supporting watch-only on-chain wallets in `lnd` where an online node would only have public keys to track the UTXOs and would delegate the signing to a non-networked `lnd` node that has the private keys, all through using PSBTs.
Read more about the possible use cases and dive into the examples [in our PSBT documentation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/psbt.md).

## Build System

Leveraging the power of GitHub Workflows, we now [automatically build and push docker images](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4769) of all our releases [to Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/lightninglabs). This includes images for `amd64` and [`arm64`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4852).

The distinction between the production `Dockerfile` and the development `dev.Dockerfile` [were made more clear in the documentation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4790).

The release binaries for all OS/architectures are now [also built by a GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4777). The deterministic build system introduced in a previous release allows us to independently build and sign the binaries locally. Signatures of more than just one developer will be added to releases in the future.

The experiential build tag has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4701) for the `assumechanvalid` flag that is used to prevent long rescans for neutrino nodes.

## Continuous Integration

Our continuous integration pipeline, most notably our integration tests, has received a number of improvements and bug fixes making them considerably faster and somewhat more stable:
- An integration test suite running [against a `bitcoind` with the TX index disabled](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4617) was added.
- The ~70 integration tests are now [split into 4 parts and run in parallel](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4655) reducing the execution time by ~50%.
- Log files are only uploaded to termbin.com and file.io [for failed runs](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4623) and the `bitcoind` binaries are [extracted from a docker image instead of being downloaded](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4623), shaving off a few more minutes from the total itest execution time.
- The test harness for the `btcd` node used as the mining node [were improved to fix port collisions](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4765) which resulted in flaky tests.
- A check was added that [forces new command line flags to also be documented in the `sample-lnd.conf` file](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4626).
- A new make target [for itest flake hunting](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4756) was added.
- New make targets [for running fuzz tests](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4643) were added.
- Build tags were removed from the integration test files, [allowing the linter to check those as well](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4593).
- The `zpay32` package's `Decode` and `Encode` functions now have [corresponding fuzz tests](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4651) in the `fuzz` package.
- The `brontide` fuzz tests have been [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4640).
- Fuzz testing has been [optimized](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4682) to instruct `gofuzz` to always mutate the input.

## Contract Court Performance Improvements
Performance [improvements](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4697) were made to the contract court subsystem which is responsible for closing out channels on chain and taking on-chain actions required to fully resolve the channel. The number of database transactions required to start up the subsystem has been reduced from one per channel to a single transaction, which reduces startup time. Improvements to the way the subsystem consumes new blocks from its backing bitcoin node have also improved the memory footprint of the system. 

## Extended Health Checks 

[A new optional `healthcheck` has been added to insturct `lnd` to restart itself in order to _refresh_ an expired RPC TLS cert](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4792). This change is useful in containerized contexts such as k8s, where an auto restarting `lnd` is able to propagate any auth changes in a decoupled manner upon restart. 

## `htlcswitch` Enhancements 

Database contention has been [reduced](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4547) in the link by batching removal of forwarding packages. The removal timer has also been increased from 1 minute to 1 hour.

[A bug has been fixed in our non-strict forwarding randomization](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4659) to ensure we explciitly randomize our link sleection rather than relying on the undefined ordering of map interation in the Go spec. 

## Peer Flap Rate Tracking

An [update](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4440) to the channel fitness subsystem has introduced tracking of the number of times lnd is connected and disconnected from each of its peers. This information is surfaced in the output of the `ListPeers` API. 

The flap rate we have recorded for peers is also used to rate limit the amount of data lnd will store to track the peer’s uptime. If a peer has a high flap rate, lnd will reduce the amount of data it stores in memory, resulting in more aggregated uptime information. This change is intended to protect against constantly flapping peers, and will have little effect on peers that are consistently online with the occasional restart. To ensure that we do not permanently punish a peer for a period of instability long in the past, the flap rate we track for peers is exponentially cooled down over time. 

## RPC Enchancements &amp; Bug Fixes 

### Uniform Unconfirmed Coin Selection for SendCoins+

[`lnd` now allows all RPC calls that craft and send transactions to spend unconfirmed coins](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4653). 

This change the following RPCs:

- `Lightning.SendCoins`
- `Lightning.SendMany`
- `WalletKit.SendOutputs`

We've added two new parameters for these methods, following the same format as used for `Lightning.OpenChannel` RPC:

- `min_confs` (default=1)
- `spend_unconfirmed` (default=false)


### Macaroon Root ID Key Rotation 

[`lnd` now supports _root ID_ key rotation](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4427). This allows the baker (creator) of a set of macaroons to _invalidate_ them all by deleting and regenerating the root key used to generate the macaroons. This feature is a useful security tool, as if an application/system that uses lnd's macaroons in a fine grained manner is compromised, the admin is able to _revoke_ all generated macaroons. 

Several new calls have been added to allow users to take advantage of this feature, namely:
  * The `lncli bakemacaroon` call now accepts a new parameter: `root_key_id`. This new field is an integer that can be used to rotate root ID keys. 
  * A new `lncli listmacaroonids` command has been added to allow callers to monitor all their existing allocated root IDs.
  * A new `lncli deletemacaroonid` call has been added which implements _macaroon revocation_ by allowing the caller to _delete_ a specified root key ID. 
 
 
### New Verbose Output for `ChannelBalance`

[The `lncli channebalance` call now returns much more information than before in order to give users more insight w.r.t exactly _how_ their funds are distributed off-chain](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4512). An output of the new call resmbles the following: 
```
⛰lncli channelbalance
{
    &quot;balance&quot;: &quot;27476201&quot;,
    &quot;pending_open_balance&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
    &quot;local_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;27476201&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;27476201135&quot;
    },
    &quot;remote_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;109137173&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;109137173865&quot;
    },
    &quot;unsettled_local_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;
    },
    &quot;unsettled_remote_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;
    },
    &quot;pending_open_local_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;0&quot;
    },
    &quot;pending_open_remote_balance&quot;: {
        &quot;sat&quot;: &quot;1783362&quot;,
        &quot;msat&quot;: &quot;1783362000&quot;
    }
}
```

Note that the first two fields (`balance` and `pending_open_balance`) are now deprecated and will be _removed_ in the future. Callers should use the new fields that return both `sat` and `msat` instead. 

### Raw Key Support for `SharedKeyRequest`

[The `DeriveSharedKey` now accepts a raw public key in addition to key locator](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4436). 

### Additional HTLC Information in ListChannels

[The `ListChannels` call will now return additional information about the set of linked HTLCs in a channel](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4693). Namely, we'll now return: 
  * The `htlc_index` of the HTLC within the channel 
  * The `forwarding_channel`, or the channel that forwarded the HTLC to the targte channel 
  * The `forwarding_htlc_index`, or the HTLC index on the forwarded channel. 

### Automated Let's Encrypt Certificates 

A new series of command line flags have been added to `lnd` which allows users to automatically obtain and renew a Let's Encrypt Certificate for the RPC interface of their `lnd` node. With this change, in certain configurations, callers will be able to hit an `lnd` now without having to manually store and update the `tls.cert` locally. 
New flags added to the `lnd` command line and `lnd.conf`:

* `--letsencryptport`: The port on which lnd will listen for Let's Encrypt challenges. Let's Encrypt will always try to contact on port 80. Often non-root processes are not allowed to bind to ports lower than 1024. This configuration option allows a different port to be used, but must be used in combination with port forwarding from port 80.
* `--letsencryptdir`: The directory to store Let's Encrypt certificates within. By default this is `.lnd/letsencrypt`.
* `--letsencryptdomain`: Request a Let's Encrypt certificate for the domain specified using this flag.

When `lncli` cannot find a `tls.cert` file, it will assume the server has a valid (Let's Encrypt) certificate. It is important to pass the domain name as a command line flag to `lncli`:

`lncli --rpcserver my.domain.org:10009`

This is necessary as well when connecting to `localhost`.

### Custom Routing Hints for AddHoldInvoice 

[The `AddHoldInvoice` RPC call now allows the users to specify their own custom routing hints](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/3672). 



### Allow No RPC Auth on Private Addresses 

[A new config evaluation has been added to allow user to instruct `lnd` that it should allow RPC requests with no authentiation _only_ if `lnd` is listening on a private address](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4473). This makes certain Docker based configurations more user friendly, as any dependent containers no longer need to obtain and update lnd's RPC authentication information. Assuming `lnd` is only listening on a non-public private interface, then the `--no-macaroons` config option is now valid.  

### New Channel Acceptor Parameters
Additional [fields](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4683) have been added to the `ChannelAcceptor` API, which allow custom setting of custom errors for the remote peer, an upfront shutdown address for the channel (if supported by the peer), and more. Note that the error provided will be sent to the peer verbatim, so should not contain sensitive information.

### Maximum Local CSV
When opening a channel, the remote party can specify the CSV delay for your funds. This value determines the amount of time that your balance will be unavailable in the case where your force close the channel. A [`max_local_csv` parameter](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4735) has been added to allow setting of custom limitations on this value. For outgoing channels, this can be set using the `max_local_csv` field in the `OpenChannel` request. The `maxlocaldelay` config value can be used to set a default maximum value for all channels.

### Disable TLS for REST
It is now possible to [disable TLS for REST RPC](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4648) using `--no-rest-tls`.

## Refactoring
This release sees the removal of several components from the main `lnd` package:
- `fundingmanager.go` and tests are [moved](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4757) to the `funding` package.
- `chainregistry.go` and `chainparams.go` have been [moved](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4487) to the `chainreg` package.
- `mock.go` has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4542) in favor of the `lntest/mock` package.
- A global variable `activeNetParams` has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4505).

The `peer` package's dependency on `brontide` has been [removed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4645).
## Miscellaneous

The DNS servers to use for initial peer bootstrapping [can now be specified](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4744) to overwrite the hard coded default values.

All supported command line flags are now [also properly documented in the `sample-lnd.conf` file](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4626).

[A new flag has been added to instruct `lnd` to timeout early if it can't obtain the file lock on bolt DB](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4787). 

### Multi node management

Hosting nodes on non-trusted (cloud) hardware was made safer by adding a [stateless initialization mode](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/1288) that instructs `lnd` to not store any unencrypted macaroons on the host's file system. Instead, the admin macaroon is returned in the response of the wallet creation request and must be stored by the caller.

To support the stateless initialization mode mentioned above on the client side as well, [configuration profiles for `lncli` can now be created](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4310). Those profiles make it easy to interact with multiple nodes from the same client machine. For additional security the macaroons stored in the profiles can optionally be encrypted with a password.

### Recovery

Forcing the on-chain wallet to rescan its state from chain was [made easier by adding the `--reset-wallet-transactions` flag](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4715) to `lnd` that replaces the functionality previously only available in the external tool `dropwtxmgr`.

### Individual subsystem log levels
A change that makes it possible to set the [log level for individual subsystems](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4772) was merged. One can now specify a global log level, and subsystem log levels that will override the global setting: `--debuglevel=debug,PEER=info,SRVR=trace`.


## Bug fixes

- A bug in [the restore logic for old SCB files](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4865) was fixed that caused the `a height hint greater than 0 must be provided` error.
- A bug was fixed in how we [watch for states on chain](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4780), that could cause us to ignore our own close transaction if we attempted recovery while our force close transaction was still in the mempool.
- All directories referenced by command line flags are [now properly created](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4622) on startup.
- Neutrino users can now [specify a full node backend with an Onion v2 address](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4806). Before this fix, only clearnet addresses were supported.
- The chain backend health check which ensures that lnd is reliably connected to a bitcoin node has been [updated](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4755) to use the `uptime` api for bitcoind nodes. This check previously used the `getBlockChainInfo` API, which proved unsuitable because it could take up to 5 minutes for bitcoind to respond due to non-granular locking in core.
- A bug in the `walletrpc` subserver’s `ListSweeps` endpoint where the `verbose` output option would fail if a sweep was not found on chain has been [fixed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4762). This could happen for transactions that were replaced-by-fee. 
- [`lnd` will no longer allow restoted channels to be manually closed](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4525). This fixes a class of issues that would cause `lnd` to be unable to start due to a borked local channel state. 
- [`lnd` will no longer attempt to trap SIGABRT](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4627). 
- [A bug has been fixed related to mnemonic seed validation on restore](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4738). This ensures `lnd` will properly catch invalid words (that aren't in the wordlist) much earlier than before. 
- [All errors in the `routerrpc` server will now be properly mapped to gRPC status codes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4691). 
- [`lnd` nodes using the neutrino backend will now properly be able to connect to onion v2 onion service addresses](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4806).

    <summary># Eclair v0.5.0

This release includes many exciting new features, API changes as well as several bug fixes and improvements.
It is fully compatible with 0.4.2 (and all previous versions of eclair).

# Major changes

### Cluster mode

Eclair now allows you to scale up one _logical_ lightning node across multiple servers.

Front servers take care of routing table related gossip and syncing requests from peers, which is cpu/bandwidth intensive.
The backend server can focus on core channel management.
BOLT 1 and BOLT 7 messages are handled in the frontend, while BOLT 2 messages go through and are processed in the backend.

This new feature is key for robust and scalable enterprise deployments.
Head over to the [documentation](./docs/Cluster.md) for more details.

### Blockchain watchdogs

Eclair now includes a blockchain watchdog, that fetches bitcoin headers from various sources in order to detect whether we're being [eclipsed](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/263.pdf).

The current blockchain sources we use are:

- blockchainheaders.net (headers over DNS)
- blockstream.info
- mempool.space

### Seed segregation

Eclair now splits your seed into two distinct parts: `node_seed.dat` and `channel_seed.dat`.

It makes sense to separate the keys that are used for connection handling and gossip (and have no impact on your funds) from the keys that are used for channel operations (and have a direct, critical impact on your funds).

This change paves the way for future security improvements, such as using hardware wallets for channel keys.

### Per-node feerate tolerance

On-chain feerate spikes have a subtle but important impact on the security of your channel funds.
Eclair lets you configure the tolerance you have with your peers via the `eclair.on-chain-fees.feerate-tolerance` configuration parameter.

With this release, you can now override this configuration for specific nodes.
This can be useful when one of your peer is trusted and you know it won't try to cheat you (for example because it's one of your own nodes, a family member's node or a friend).
You can configure a higher feerate tolerance with these nodes than with nodes you don't know or trust.

### Plugin improvements

More plugins hooks have been added to eclair, to allow custom connection management and custom commitment formats.
Hats off to @btcontract who was able to implement [hosted channels](https://github.com/btcontract/hosted-channels-rfc) entirely as an eclair plugin!

### API changes

This release contains a few improvements to existing APIs:

- The `channelId` field has been added to the `channel-state-changed` websocket event
- Initial relay fees can be configured when opening a channel with the `open` API

Head over to our [API documentation](https://acinq.github.io/eclair) for more details.

### Miscellaneous improvements and bug fixes

- #1617 lets you redirect traffic automatically from a tor node to a normal node
- `option_static_remotekey` is now optionally activated by default

# Verifying signatures

You will need `gpg` and our release signing key 7A73FE77DE2C4027. Note that you can get it:

- from our website: https://acinq.co/pgp/drouinf.asc
- from github user @sstone, a committer on eclair: https://api.github.com/users/sstone/gpg_keys

To import our signing key:

```sh
$ gpg --import drouinf.asc
```

To verify the release file checksums and signatures:

```sh
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped
```

# Building

Eclair builds are deterministic. To reproduce our builds, please use the following environment (*):

- Ubuntu 19.10
- AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.6
- Maven 3.6.3

Use the following command to generate the eclair-node package:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

That should generate `eclair-node/target/eclair-node-0.5.0-XXXXXXX-bin.zip` with sha256 checksums that match the one we provide and sign in `SHA256SUMS.asc`

(*) You may be able to build the exact same artefacts with other operating systems or versions of JDK 11, we have not tried everything.

# Upgrading

This release is fully compatible with Eclair v0.4.2. You don't need to close your channels, just stop eclair, upgrade and restart.

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.0-beta.rc1"/>
    <summary>This release marks the first major release in the `v0.12.x` series! As this is a major release several new features are included in this release including: anchor commitment types are now the default, anchor commitment support for watchtowers, new arguments to auto compact the database as well as drop the `wtxmgr` state, generic wallet PSBT crafting+signing, and more more! As usual this release contains several important bug fixes, so we recommend at all users update. 

# Database Migrations
TODO

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc1.txt` and `manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc1.txt.sig` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc1.txt.sig
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: assuming signed data in 'manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc1.txt'
gpg: Signature made Tue Dec 15 18:57:27 2020 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.


For this release roasbeef's signature is the secondary signature which can be verified with the following command: 
```
gpg --verify roasbeef-manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc1.txt.sig manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc1.txt
gpg: Signature made Wed Sep 30 17:35:20 2020 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 4AB7F8DA6FAEBB3B70B1F903BC13F65E2DC84465
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc1.txt.sig.ots` and `manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc1.txt.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc1.txt.ots
ots verify manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc1.txt.sig.ots -f roasbeef-manifest-v0.12.0-beta.rc1.txt.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.15.6`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, and `watchtowerrpc`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.12.0-beta.rc1
gpg: Signature made Tue 15 Dec 2020 10:31:06 PM UTC using RSA key ID 9B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot;
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.12.0-beta.rc1.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.12.0-beta.rc1.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.0-beta.rc1&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.12.0-beta.rc1&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

    <summary>## Main changes

#### Support for lightning parameters in BIP21 invoices

BIP21 URIs can contain a `lightning` field if the recipient also accepts lightning payments. In that case the wallet now lets the user choose how he wants to pay the invoice.

#### Improve swapout feerate

Minimum feerate for swapout is now dynamic and should adjust with the state of the mempool.

    <summary>**A newer version is already available! Please don’t use this version anymore.**

This is a hotfix that fixes critical bugs that can occur during the trade process!

For a full list of changes please see [milestone v1.5.1](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/milestone/46) for more details.

Here are the release notes from v1.5.0:

## Release notes

This release finally brings SegWit to Bisq's trade protocol. It also implements fee optimizations enabled by SegWit, so mining fees for all BTC transactions are lower.

There are also some notable trading-related updates: you can now edit pricing and payment methods of your live offers; account limits have been simplified (and removed where unneeded); and 3 new payment methods were added (Australian PayID, TransferWise and Amazon gift cards).

The SegWit integration wouldn't have been possible without the anonymous sponsor who pre-funded the project, so big thanks to them! If you might be interested in pre-funding a specific feature, please contact us on Keybase in the #projects channel. Bisq is a critical element of the Bitcoin ecosystem and could really use your help.

### DAO
- [Use LegacyAddress instead of Address for BSQ](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/4681)
- [Remove outliers when calculating BSQ rate](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/4706)

## Verification

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.5.1.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
`shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/Java/Bisq-1.5.1.jar`
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.5.1.jar.txt file.


## Known issues with installation 

### macOS Catalina:

&gt; Bisq can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

This happens the first time Bisq is run on macOS Catalina. It is because a new security feature in Catalina has newer requirements of how apps are packaged. We are working on ways to address this (see #3402 and #4196 for details).

Workaround: Right click on the installed Bisq app &gt; Click `Open` (warning popup shown again, but with new button available) &gt; Click `Open`

&gt; Bisq would like to receive keystrokes from any application.

Discussed in issue https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3373, you will see a permission request in the latest macOS version that Bisq wants to receive keystrokes from any application. Unfortunately that is an issue for all Java applications that are run on Catalina right now. We are investigating already how to solve this issue and will fix in one of our next updates.

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/Bisq/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.5.1.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it. 

## Cleanup tool for saved trades that failed market price check

With this release we are also shipping a cleanup tool (Bisq-cleanup-trades*). It will remove corrupt trade entries added due to bug https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/2924. Install and run once, it will shut down automatically, then install version 1.5.1 or later. You can verify the binary the same way as you do with the Bisq application.
