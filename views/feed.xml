    <summary>### Fix compatibility issue with LND 0.15.1-beta

The legacy Phoenix app on android used bit 50 for the trampoline feature bit, which has since been reused for zeroconf with a dependency on scid_alias. The legacy app now uses bit 148 instead. This fixes an issue that prevented the android app from receiving payment sent from LND 0.15.1-beta

    <link href="https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/releases/tag/1.9.4"/>
    <summary># 1.9.4

This release is backwards compatible with the 1.9.x series of bitcoin-s

See the individual module sections for more information on lower level updates to the codebase.

Want to get started quickly? See our `docker-compose.yml` file. [See instructions here](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/#docker)

If you are a typescript developer, [you can access the backend via our typescript library](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s-ts)

# Executive Summary

This is a bug fix release. In our 1.9.3 release we did not successfully publish all jars for the libraries.
For more information see: https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/issues/4725

This release drops support for Scala 2.12.x, which fixes this bug. It also updates some dependencies.

This release also adds the abillity to test connections with peers before sending offers and accepts. See #4720

## Running bitcoin-s

If you want to run the standalone server binary, after verifying gpg signatures, you
can `unzip bitcoin-s-server-1.9.4.zip` and then run it with `chmod +x ./bin/bitcoin-s-server &amp;&amp; ./bin/bitcoin-s-server` to start the node. You will need to
configure the node properly first, you can find example
configurations [here](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/config/configuration#example-configuration-file).

You can then unzip the `bitcoin-s-cli-1.9.4.zip` folder and start using the `bitcoin-s-cli` like this:

```bashrc
./bin/bitcoin-s-cli --help
Usage: bitcoin-s-cli [options] [&lt;cmd&gt;]

  -n, --network &lt;value&gt;    Select the active network.
  --debug                  Print debugging information
  --rpcport &lt;value&gt;        The port to send our rpc request to on the server
  -h, --help               Display this help message and exit
```

For more information on what commands `bitcoin-s-cli` supports check the documentation, here is where to
start: https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/applications/server#server-endpoints

## Verifying signatures

This release is signed with [Chris's signing key](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/security#disclosure) with
fingerprint `9234F4D6AF47C71B741A390F8976CA0AF71A7A2A`

To do the verification, first hash the executable using `sha256sum`. You should check that the result is listed in
the `SHA256SUMS.asc` file next to its file name. After doing that you can use `gpg --verify` to authenticate the
signature.

Example:

```
$ gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
gpg: Signature made Wed 14 Sep 2022 10:21:24 AM CDT
gpg:                using RSA key 9234F4D6AF47C71B741A390F8976CA0AF71A7A2A
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Chris Stewart &lt;stewart.chris1234@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]

$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped

    <summary># &quot;Saturated with Messages&quot;

## API Updates
 * Support for relaying onion messages has been added via a new
   `OnionMessenger` struct when passed as the `OnionMessageHandler` to a
   `PeerManager`. Pre-encoded onion messages can also be sent and received
   (#1503, #1650, #1652, #1688).
 * Rate-limiting of outbound gossip syncs has been rewritten to utilize less
   buffering inside LDK. The new rate-limiting is also used for onion messages
   to avoid delaying other messages (#1604. #1660, #1683).
 * Rather than spawning a full OS thread, `lightning-background-processor` has
   a new `process_events_async` method which takes the place of a
   `BackgroundProcessor` for those using Rust's async (#1657).
 * `ChannelManager::get_persistable_update_future` has been added to block on
   a ChannelManager needing re-persistence in a Rust async environment (#1657).
 * The `Filter::register_output` return value has been removed, as it was
   very difficult to correctly implement (i.e., without blocking). Users
   previously using it should instead pass dependent transactions in via
   additional `chain::Confirm::transactions_confirmed` calls (#1663).
 * `ChannelHandshakeConfig::their_channel_reserve_proportional_millionths` has
   been added to allow configuring counterparty reserve values (#1619).
 * `KeysInterface::ecdh` has been added as an ECDH oracle (#1503, #1658).
 * The `rust-bitcoin` dependency has been updated 0.29 (#1658).
 * The `bitcoin_hashes` dependency has been updated 0.11 (#1677).
 * `ChannelManager::broadcast_node_announcement` has been moved to
   `PeerManager` (#1699).
 * `channel_` and `node_announcement`s are now rebroadcast automatically to all
   new peers which connect (#1699).
 * `{Init,Node}Features` sent to peers/broadcasted are now fetched via the
   various `*MessageHandler` traits, rather than hard-coded (#1701, #1688).
 * `Event::PaymentPathFailed::rejected_by_dest` has been renamed
   `payment_failed_permanently` (#1702).
 * `Invoice` now derives the std `Hash` trait (#1575).
 * `{Signed,}RawInvoice::hash` have been renamed `signable_hash` (#1714).
 * `chain::AccessError` now derives the std `Debug` trait (#1709).
 * `ReadOnlyNetworkGraph::list_{channels,nodes}` have been added largely for
   users of downstream bindings (#1651).
 * `ChannelMonitor::get_counterparty_node_id` is now available (#1635).

## Bug Fixes
 * The script compared with that returned from `chain::Access` was incorrect
   ~half of the time, causing spurious gossip rejection (#1666).
 * Pending in-flight HTLCs are now considered when calculating new routes,
   ensuring, e.g. MPP retries do not take known-saturated paths (#1643).
 * Counterparty-revoked outputs are now included in `get_claimable_balance`
   output via a new `Balance::CounterpartyRevokedOutputClaimable` (#1495).
 * Inbound HTLCs for which we do not (yet) have a preimage are now included in
   `get_claimable_balance` via a `Balance::MaybePreimageClaimableHTLC` (#1673).
 * Probes that fail prior to being sent over their first hop are correctly
   failed with a `Event::ProbeFailed` rather than a `PaymentPathFailed` (#1704).
 * Pending `Event::HTLCHandlingFailed`s are no longer lost on restart (#1700).
 * HTLCs that fail prior to being sent over their first hop are now marked as
   retryable via `!PaymentPathFailed::payment_failed_permanently` (#1702).
 * Dust HTLCs are now considered failed in the payment tracking logic after the
   commitment transaction confirms, allowing retry on restart (#1691).
 * On machines with buggy &quot;monotonic&quot; clocks, LDK will no longer panic if time
   goes backwards (#1692).

## Backwards Compatibility
 * The new `current_time` argument to `PeerManager` constructors must be set to
   a UNIX timestamp for upgraded nodes; new nodes may use a counter (#1699).
 * `Balance::CounterpartyRevokedOutputClaimable` will never be generated for
   channels that were observed to go on-chain with LDK versions prior to
   0.0.111 (#1495).
 * `ChannelMonitor::get_counterparty_node_id` will return `None` for all
   channels opened on a version of LDK prior to 0.0.110 (#1635).
 * Setting `their_channel_reserve_proportional_millionths` to any value other
   than the default will cause LDK versions prior to 0.0.104 to be unable to
   read the serialized `ChannelManager` (#1619).

## Security
0.0.111 fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability which is reachable from
untrusted input in deployments accepting 0conf channels, or via a race-condition
in deployments creating outbound 0conf channels.

 * LDK versions prior to 0.0.111 may spuriously panic when receiving a block if
   they are awaiting the construction of a funding transaction for a 0-conf
   channel (#1711). 0-conf support was added in LDK version 0.0.107.

    <link href="https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/releases/tag/HOP-4.1.0"/>
    <summary>## Summary

This release brings new JSON-RPC tracing methods, support for the latest versions of Hardhat development environment, the introduction of a peer reputation system, and support for RocksDb storage library, among other things. While this is a non-mandatory upgrade, we encourage users to upgrade their nodes to the new version.

## What's New in RSKj 4.1.0

A non-comprehensive list of changes included in this version is:

- Introduced a new peer reputation system in[ #1737](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1737),[ #1739](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1739),[ #1740](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1740),[ #1745](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1745),[ #1750](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1750),[ #1772](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1772), and[ #1782](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1782) `[experimental]`.
- Introduced two new JSON-RPC tracing methods: `trace_get` and `trace_filter` in[ #1711](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1711), and[ #1744](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1744).
- Added support for `RocksDb` storage library in[ #1703](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1703) `[experimental]`. See [RSK Developers Portal](https://developers.rsk.co/rsk/node/configure/#using-rocksdb-experimental) for more information.
- Fixed corner case bug in `eth_estimateGas` JSON-RPC method in[ #1803](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1803).
- Accept websocket connections without requiring the `websocket` suffix in the URL path in[ #1753](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1753).
- Improved the `eth_gasPrice` method by fetching historical gas prices from DB at node startup in[ #1724](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1724).
- Added `Content-Length` and `Connection` headers to JSON-RPC responses, solving issues Hardhat users had when interacting with RSKj, in[ #1836](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1836).

You can find a complete list of the changes introduced in [Hop 4.1.0 milestone](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/milestone/30).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/compare/HOP-4.0.0...HOP-4.1.0

**NOTE:** features marked as `[experimental]` are disabled by default. They require further validation and should only be used with caution. They can be changed or removed in future releases of the node. If you don't know what these features are or their possible impact, you likely should not enable them.

# Modules 

## app commons

Consolidate duplicate data structures in `cli` and `appServer` into a common location.

66d298be3e Add SatoshisPerVirtualByte json serializers (#4672)
825937ea5f Add more JSON serializers (#4628)
b7c7cb8fc2 Moving duplicate dataStructures in `cli` and `app-server` into `app-commons` (#4541)

## App server

This release adds the ability to call `loadwallet [wallet-name] [aes-password-opt] [bip39-password-opt]`.
This RPC allows you to load a new wallet in bitcoin-s without shutting down and restarting the server.

This release also adds the rpc `exportseed [wallet-name] [aes-password-opt]` to export the mnemonic seed for a wallet.

Websocket events added this release are 

- fee rate change
- rescan complete
- sync complete
- tor started

a0ab0638f8 Allow for custom channel sizes in LndRpcTestUtil.createNodePair (#4398)

## Lnurl

## node

This release merges multi-peer neutrino support. This release does NOT enable multi peer support by default.

These new configurations are introduced in #4408. Adjust it if you want different behavior.
```
bitcoin-s.node.peers = [] # put ip/dns addresses here to force connections to these peers
bitcoin-s.node.maxConnectedPeers = 1 # try to connect to peers from dns seeds, database, addr messages etc
bitcoin-s.node.enable-peer-discovery = false # use the defauls suredbits neutrino node as a peer
bitcoin-s-.node.use-default-peers = true # whether to use suredbits hosted peer
```

This PR also implements `NodeCallbacks` with akka streams so we can safely call `loadwallet`
when node callbacks are being executed. Now we want for the streams to complete, and then continue
loading the next wallet.

## Oracle Explorer Client

8638d14ca0 Update Oracle Explorer addreess (#4609)

## wallet

This release introduces akka streams in the wallet module.

With this new dependency, we implemented rescan's with streams so that the rescan can be arbitrarily terminated
by the user. The streaming feature was needed to implement the `loadwallet` rpc call safely when a rescan is ongoing.

The wallet now emits a websocket event when a rescan is complete.

This release also fixes a bug in rescans where a single tranaction pays to multiple wallet addresses.
If those addresses were generated in _separate_ batches during a rescan, funds wouldn't be discovered.
This is unlikely to happen in practice. Consider rescanning your wallet though on the 1.9.3 release.

Various refactors and optimizations were needed to complete the rescan and `loadwallet` work.

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.15.1-beta"/>
    <summary>This marks the first minor release of the 0.15.x cyle! This release includes support for zero conf channels, scid alisases (random scid values in the invoice), switches to using taproot addresses everywhere applicable by default, and also includes an _optional_ database migration that can potential reclaim GBs of disk space for old or large lnd nodes. 


# Database Migrations

This release contains an _optional_ migration to _delete_ old revocation log space. The v0.15 release contained an &quot;on the fly&quot; migration that will start to write items in the revocation log in a more efficient manner. This release allows users to reclaim all the old disk space by converting historical records to the new format, with the old records being deleted. 

The migration can be activated with a new CLI command: `--db.prune-revocation`.  This migration can be restart at any time, with the migration logic picking up from where it left off. 

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/master/scripts/keys/roasbeef.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.15.1-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.15.1-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.15.1-beta.sig manifest-v0.15.1-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Tue Aug 30 14:21:09 2022 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.15.1-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.15.1-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.15.1-beta.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.18.2`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `neutrinorpc`, `routerrpc`, `watchtowerrpc`, `monitoring`, `peersrpc`, `kvdb_postrgres`, and `kvdb_etcd`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.15.1-beta
gpg: Signature made Tue 30 Aug 2022 08:19:04 PM UTC using RSA key ID 9B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot;
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.15.1-beta /verify-install.sh v0.15.1-beta
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.15.1-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.15.1-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.15.1-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.15.1-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

    <summary># Binaries

There are two types of binaries:

## Specter Desktop
It's a windowed GUI application with Specter server included.
Supported platforms: [Windows](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/download/v1.12.0/Specter-Setup-v1.12.0.exe), [MacOS](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/download/v1.12.0/Specter-v1.12.0.dmg), [Linux (x86_64)](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/download/v1.12.0/specter_desktop-v1.12.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz)

**Note on Linux**: you need to set up udev rules (included in the archive). Check out [readme](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/blob/master/udev/README.md#usage).

**Note on macOS**: The current build supports only macOS Catalina (10.15) or higher. If you'd like to run Specter on an older macOS version, you can [install Specter from Pip](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop#installing-specter-from-pip).

## specterd
It's a command-line program that only runs Specter server.

### New Assets
No new assets added.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.9.5.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.9.5-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.9.5.jar.txt file.

There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.9.5.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 15.0.6 and the v1.9.5 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.

## API
[API]: #api-documentation
Starting with v1.9.0 you can use pre-built versions of the Bisq cli (bisq-cli-v1.9.5.zip) and Bisq daemon (bisq-daemon-v1.9.5.zip) to use Bisq without touching the user interface.

Just download the archives and extract them locally. You have to run the daemon to access the local Bisq daemon API endpoints.

To run daemon.jar on Mainnet:
```bash
$ java -jar daemon.jar --apiPassword=becareful
```

If you just want to control your headless daemon within your terminal you have to run the Bisq cli as well.

Again just download the bisq-cli archive and extract it locally.

To call getversion from cli.jar
```bash
$ java -jar cli.jar --password=becareful getversion
```

You can use the Bisq API to access local Bisq daemon API endpoints, which provide a subset of the Bisq Desktop application's feature set: check balances, transfer BTC and BSQ, create payment accounts, view offers, create and take offers, and execute trades.

The Bisq API is based on the gRPC framework, and any supported gRPC language binding can be used to call Bisq API endpoints.

You'll find in-depth documentation and examples under following link: https://bisq-network.github.io/slate/#introduction

Bisq gRPC API reference documentation example source code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-api-reference. Java and Python developers interested in bot development may find this Intellij project useful for running the existing examples, and writing their own bots.

For additional developer support please join [Development - Bisq v1](https://matrix.to/#/%23bisq.dev:bitcoin.kyoto) on Matrix.

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.9.5.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/releases/tag/v0.12.0"/>
    <summary>We're pleased to announce the 0.12.0 release of core-lightning, named by @adi2011.

**Developers**: please note the Great Msat Migration in the APIs!

## Highlights for Users

- *NEW* Built-in `bookkeeper` plugin! This plugin tracks all movements of msats for your node, gives you a better idea of your costs and revenues, prints out CSVs that are uploadable to Koinly and CoinTracker, lets you inspect the on-chain footprint of a channel (useful when it goes to chain). Check out the new `bkpr-` prefixed commands.
- *NEW* Built-in `commando` plugin! This lets you create runes to allow access to your node from a commando client, which will let you send and receive RPC commands over the lightning network.
- *NEW* Emergency channel backup (&quot;static backup&quot;)! Keep track of what peers you have channels with, and in case of node failure ask those peers to close the channel.
- *NEW* zeroconf channels are possible for whitelisted peers. 
- `hsmtool` has a new command, `checkhsm`, which will let you check a BIP30 passphrase against the `hsm_secret`.
- Multiple `log-file` options will open multiple files for logging.
- Various crashes and issues fixed in `connectd` including crash on peer reconnect and large memory usage when many concurrent peers.
- PSBT: fixes signature encoding to comply with BIP-0174.
- We added dynamically detected public IP addresses to `getinfo`.
- Due to dependency issues on some platforms, a tarball of pre-generated manual pages is included with this release.


## Highlights for the Network

- We prefer IPv6 connections when available.
- We now accept spam gossip and use it for routing, but don't relay it.
- We no longer create gossip messages with zlib encoding (but still understand them).
- We treat LND &quot;internal error&quot; as warnings, not force close events (reverts to v0.10.0 behavior).


## Highlights for Developers

- `_msat` fields are added wherever they were missing in the API: they're still currently an &quot;msat&quot;-suffixed string, but will soon bean integer value. Test with deprecated_apis=false.
- The `channel_state_changed` notification now fires when a channel moves into state `CHANNELD_AWAITING_LOCKIN`.
- `htlc_accepted_hook` will now expose the `short_channel_id` and the per-channel HTLC `id`.
- `pyln-testing` now includes utilities to read and parse the gossip\_store.
- `startup_regtest.sh` script now includes a `fund_ln` method.
- Rust binaries such as `cln-grpc` now included in our reproducible builds.
- Updated the bolts implementation for pyln-spec.
- Plugins no longer hang indefinitely if `lightningd` closes their connection.
- M1 architecture support.
- Upgrade docker base image from Debian buster to bullseye, works with glibc 2.29+.
- Docker images now built with rust plugin `cln-grpc`.


Since v0.11.1 we've had 508 commits from 31 different contributors over 80 days.

A special thanks goes to 9 first time contributors:

- Aditya Sharma
- Alex Myers
- Igor Bubelov
- Justin Moon
- Peter Neuroth
- Swapnil

    <link href="https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/releases/tag/HOP-4.0.0"/>
    <summary>**IMPORTANT 1:** since consensus rules have changed, this version is not compatible with previous versions. If you've been running previous versions of the RSK client node, we encourage you to update to this new version. The **Mainnet** network upgrade will happen at **block number 4,598,500**. The **Testnet** network upgrade will happen at **block number 3,103,000**.

**IMPORTANT 2:** this release makes the `sco`, `debug`, and `trace` JSON-RPC modules disabled by default. For security reasons, it is suggested to have these modules enabled only when needed. Node operators that use any of these modules must consider this and enable them in their config files. See the [Node Configuration Reference](https://developers.rsk.co/rsk/node/configure/reference) page in the [RSK Developers' Portal](https://developers.rsk.co/) for details on RSK node configuration.

A non-comprehensive list of changes included in this version is:

- Bridge peg-out batching ([RSKIP-271](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP271.md))
- New deserialization method for Flyover refund addresses ([RSKIP-284](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP284.md))
- Adjust minimum block difficulty on Testnet ([RSKIP-290](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP290.md))
- Add method `getActivePowpegRedeemScript` to the Bridge contract and perform additional Flyover peg-in validations ([RSKIP-293](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP293.md))
- Limit the number of inputs to include in a migration transaction ([RSKIP-294](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP294.md))
- Increase max timestamp difference between BTC and RSK blocks for Testnet ([RSKIP-297](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP297.md))
- Increased `accountSlots` config ([#1763](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1763))
- Disable `sco`, `debug`, and `trace` rpc modules by default ([#1757](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/pull/1757))

For a detailed description of each consensus change introduced in this network upgrade, please refer to [RSKIP 291 Network Upgrade: Hop](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP291.md). You can also find a complete list of the changes introduced in the corresponding [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/milestone/29).

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/releases/tag/v0.0.110"/>
    <summary>## API Updates
 * `ChannelManager::send_probe` and `Score::probe_{failed,successful}` have
   been added to make probing more explicit, as well as new
   `Event::Probe{Failed,Successful}` events (#1567).
 * `ProbabilisticScoringParameters::banned_nodes` has been renamed
   `manual_node_penalties` and changed to take msat penalties (#1592).
 * Per-payment tracking of failed paths was added to enable configuration of
   `ProbabilisticScoringParameters::considered_impossible_penalty_msat` (#1600)
 * `ProbabilisticScoringParameters::base_penalty_amount_multiplier_msat` was
   added to allow a penalty that is only amount-dependent (#1617).
 * `ProbabilisticScoringParameters::amount_penalty_multiplier_msat` was renamed
   `liquidity_penalty_amount_multiplier_msat` (#1617).
 * A new `Event::HTLCHandlingFailed` has been added which provides visibility
   into failures to forward/claim accepted HTLCs (#1403).
 * Support has been added for DNS hostnames in the `NetAddress` type, see
   [BOLT PR #911](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/911) (#1553).
 * `GossipSync` now has `rapid`, `p2p`, and `none` constructors (#1618).
 * `lightning-net-tokio` no longer requires types to be in `Arc`s (#1623).
 * The `htlc_maximum_msat` field is now required in `ChannelUpdate` gossip
   messages. In tests this rejects &lt; 1% of channels (#1519).
 * `ReadOnlyNetworkGraph::{channel,node}` have been added to query for
   individual channel/node data, primarily for bindings users (#1543).
 * `FeeEstimator` implementations are now wrapped internally to ensure values
   below 253 sats/kW are never used (#1552).
 * Route selection no longer attempts to randomize path selection. This is
   unlikely to lead to a material change in the paths selected (#1610).

## Bug Fixes
 * Fixed a panic when deserializing `ChannelDetails` objects (#1588).
 * When routing, channels are no longer fully saturated before MPP splits are
   generated, instead a configuration knob was added as
   `PaymentParameters::max_channel_saturation_power_of_half` (#1605).
 * Fixed a panic which occurred in `ProbabilisticScorer` when wallclock time
   goes backwards across a restart (#1603).

## Serialization Compatibility
 * All new fields are ignored by prior versions of LDK. All new fields are not
   present when reading objects serialized by prior versions of LDK.
 * Channel information written in the `NetworkGraph` which is missing
   `htlc_maximum_msat` may be dropped on deserialization (#1519).
 * Similarly, node information written in the `NetworkGraph` which contains an
   invalid hostname may be dropped on deserialization (#1519).

    <summary># Eclair v0.7.0-patch-disconnect

This is a patch release which adds two commits:
- Add option to disable sending remote addr in init (#2285)
- Resume reading after processing unknown messages (#2332)

It addresses unwanted disconnections with peers that use unknown messages.

## Verifying signatures

You will need `gpg` and our release signing key 7A73FE77DE2C4027. Note that you can get it:

- from our website: https://acinq.co/pgp/drouinf.asc
- from github user @sstone, a committer on eclair: https://api.github.com/users/sstone/gpg_keys

To import our signing key:

```sh
$ gpg --import drouinf.asc
```

To verify the release file checksums and signatures:

```sh
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped
```

## Building

Eclair builds are deterministic. To reproduce our builds, please use the following environment (*):

- Ubuntu 20.04
- AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.6
- Maven 3.8.1

Use the following command to generate the eclair-node package:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

That should generate `eclair-node/target/eclair-node-0.7.0-cad88bf-bin.zip` with sha256 checksums that match the one we provide and sign in `SHA256SUMS.asc`

(*) You may be able to build the exact same artefacts with other operating systems or versions of JDK 11, we have not tried everything.

## Upgrading

This release is fully compatible with previous eclair versions. You don't need to close your channels, just stop eclair, upgrade and restart.</summary>

    <summary>In the past six months, we fixed a critical security vulnerability in one of BTCPay's versions. The security vulnerability has been disclosed responsibly, and we granted a bounty to the security researcher who discovered it. As far as we know, this particular vulnerability has not been exploited in the wild as it depends on multiple factors. For security reasons, we will not publicly disclose details yet. Timeframe for public disclosure is 6-12 months. We already have a CVE number reserved for it.

It's very likely that by updating BTCPay Server in the past six months, you've already patched this vulnerability. To be safe, update your instance if you haven't done so in a long time.

### New Assets
No new assets added.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.9.4.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.9.4-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.9.4.jar.txt file.

There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.9.4.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 15.0.6 and the v1.9.4 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.

## API
[API]: #api-documentation
Starting with v1.9.0 you can use pre-built versions of the Bisq cli (bisq-cli-v1.9.4.zip) and Bisq daemon (bisq-daemon-v1.9.4.zip) to use Bisq without touching the user interface.

Just download the archives and extract them locally. You have to run the daemon to access the local Bisq daemon API endpoints.

To run daemon.jar on Mainnet:
```bash
$ java -jar daemon.jar --apiPassword=becareful
```

If you just want to control your headless daemon within your terminal you have to run the Bisq cli as well.

Again just download the bisq-cli archive and extract it locally.

To call getversion from cli.jar
```bash
$ java -jar cli.jar --password=becareful getversion
```

You can use the Bisq API to access local Bisq daemon API endpoints, which provide a subset of the Bisq Desktop application's feature set: check balances, transfer BTC and BSQ, create payment accounts, view offers, create and take offers, and execute trades.

The Bisq API is based on the gRPC framework, and any supported gRPC language binding can be used to call Bisq API endpoints.

You'll find in-depth documentation and examples under following link: https://bisq-network.github.io/slate/#introduction

Bisq gRPC API reference documentation example source code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-api-reference. Java and Python developers interested in bot development may find this Intellij project useful for running the existing examples, and writing their own bots.

For additional developer support please join [Development - Bisq v1](https://matrix.to/#/%23bisq.dev:bitcoin.kyoto) on Matrix.

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.9.4.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <summary># Summary

_PRIVACY IS YOUR ABILITY TO SELECTIVELY REVEAL YOURSELF TO THE WORLD_

The most important change is the Tor update. There is an ongoing attack against the Tor network causing delays. Under the hood Wasabi is using Tor to anonymize network traffic, so this has an effect on us as well. The updated Tor client mitigates the problem, see Tor changelog below 👇:

- This version fixes several bugfixes including a High severity security issue
  categorized as a Denial of Service. Everyone running an earlier version
  should upgrade to this version.

- Major bugfixes (congestion control, TROVE-2022-001):
    - Fix a scenario where RTT estimation can become wedged, seriously
      degrading congestion control performance on all circuits. This
      impacts clients, onion services, and relays, and can be triggered
      remotely by a malicious endpoint. Tracked as CVE-2022-33903. Fixes
      bug 40626; bugfix on 0.4.7.5-alpha.

**It is recommended to update Wasabi to this version. Please read the What's Changed section for details.** 

⚠️ Wasabi will update Tor automatically, but you have to make sure Tor is not running when you start Wasabi. The simplest solution is to restart the computer and start this version of Wasabi. 

We live in an Orwellian surveillance society where your information is being used to typecast and manipulate you. Bitcoin projects are being pressured to collect more and more data, if possible.
This is why Wasabi Wallet is programmed to be a zero-knowledge software. Developers do not and never will collect any information about you. What you do with your bitcoin is your business.

- **OPEN SOURCE**: Wasabi Wallet is a [free, open-source](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi) and [deterministically reproducible](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/Guides/DeterministicBuildGuide.md) software. Anyone can see, verify and even contribute to the code.

- **TRUSTLESS BY DESIGN**: The software is designed so that neither the public nor the developers can breach your privacy. This is done through [coinjoins](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/), [client-side block filtering](https://nopara73.medium.com/bitcoin-core-vs-wasabi-wallet-network-level-privacy-bdca1d501387) and communication over the [Tor anonymity network.](https://www.torproject.org/)

- **NON-CUSTODIAL**: Not your keys, not your coins. Wasabi Wallet lets you control your private keys, offering you true financial self sovereignty.

- **EASY TO USE**: Wasabi is designed to be a [user friendly](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228348285_Anonymity_loves_company_Usability_and_the_network_effect) Bitcoin wallet, that handles its users' privacy automatically under the hood, including network connections, [input](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction#Input) selection and conjoining.

- **COMPREHENSIVE**: The wallet uses [WabiSabi](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/), an anonymous credential scheme that was designed to enable more accessible and efficient coinjoins. It allows users to utilize the best privacy tool without requiring a large amount of bitcoin in the wallet.

- **AFFORDABLE**: Coinjoining coins with a value above 0.01 BTC costs 0.3% as a [coordinator](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/tree/master/WalletWasabi.Backend) fee + [mining fees](https://mempool.space/). Inputs of 0.01 BTC or below don't pay coordinator fees, nor remixes, even after one transaction. Thus, a payment made with coinjoined funds allows the sender and the recipient to remix their coins without paying any coordinator fees.

# Newbie Guide

While setting up Wasabi is straightforward, even a Linux wizard with the longest beard can get stuck on the most basic tasks. Consider taking a look at the [How To Use](https://youtu.be/bQKU2khua-8) guide.

# Advanced Guide

From version 1.1.3 Wasabi also introduces [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/): [Deterministic Build Guide](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/Guides/DeterministicBuildGuide.md)

    <summary>## API Updates
 * `ChannelManager::update_channel_config` has been added to allow the fields
   in `ChannelConfig` to be changed in a given channel after open (#1527).
 * If we reconnect to a peer which proves we have a stale channel state, rather
   than force-closing we will instead panic to provide an opportunity to switch
   to the latest state and continue operating without channel loss (#1564).
 * A `NodeAlias` struct has been added which handles string sanitization for
   node aliases via the `Display` trait (#1544).
 * `ProbabilisticScoringParameters` now has a `banned_nodes` set which we will
    never route through during path finding (#1550).
 * `ProbabilisticScoringParameters` now offers an `anti_probing_penalty_msat`
   option to prefer channels which afford better privacy when routing (#1555).
 * `ProbabilisticScorer` now provides access to its estimated liquidity range
   for a given channel via `estimated_channel_liquidity_range` (#1549).
 * `ChannelManager::force_close_channel` has been renamed
   `force_close_broadcasting_latest_txn` and
   `force_close_without_broadcasting_txn` has been added (#1564).
 * Options which cannot be changed at runtime have been moved from
   `ChannelConfig` to `ChannelHandshakeConfig` (#1529).
 * `find_route` takes `&amp;NetworkGraph` instead of `ReadOnlyNetworkGraph (#1583).
 * `ChannelDetails` now contains a copy of the current `ChannelConfig` (#1527).
 * The `lightning-invoice` crate now optionally depends on `serde`, with
   `Invoice` implementing `serde::{Deserialize,Serialize}` if enabled (#1548).
 * Several fields in `UserConfig` have been renamed for clarity (#1540).

## Bug Fixes
 * `find_route` no longer selects routes with more than
   `PaymentParameters::max_mpp_path_count` paths, and
   `ChannelManager::send_payment` no longer refuses to send along routes with
   more than ten paths (#1526).
 * Fixed two cases where HTLCs pending at the time a counterparty broadcasts a
   revoked commitment transaction are considered resolved prior to their actual
   resolution on-chain, possibly passing the update to another channel (#1486).
 * HTLCs which are relayed through LDK may now have a total expiry time two
   weeks in the future, up from one, reducing forwarding failures (#1532).

## Serialization Compatibility
 * All new fields are ignored by prior versions of LDK. All new fields are not
   present when reading objects serialized by prior versions of LDK.
 * `ChannelConfig`'s serialization format has changed and is not compatible
   with any previous version of LDK. Attempts to read values written by a
   previous version of LDK will fail and attempts to read newly written objects
   using a previous version of LDK will fail. It is not expected that users are
   serializing `ChannelConfig` using the LDK serialization API, however, if a
   backward compatibility wrapper is required, please open an issue.

## Security
0.0.109 fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability which is reachable from
untrusted input in some application deployments.

 * Third parties which are allowed to open channels with an LDK-based node may
   fund a channel with a bogus and maliciously-crafted transaction which, when
   spent, can cause a panic in the channel's corresponding `ChannelMonitor`.
   Such a channel is never usable as it cannot be funded with a funding
   transaction which matches the required output script, allowing the
   `ChannelMonitor` for such channels to be safely purged as a workaround on
   previous versions of LDK. Thanks to Eugene Siegel for reporting this issue.

    <summary># Summary

_PRIVACY IS YOUR ABILITY TO SELECTIVELY REVEAL YOURSELF TO THE WORLD_

This is the first release after 2.0 version. Many improvements were made to make the software more robust and tolerant against network failures for example the ongoing distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) on the Tor network. It is recommended to update Wasabi to this version. Please read the What's Changed section for details. 

⚠️ Wasabi will update Tor automatically, but you have to make sure Tor is not running when you start Wasabi. The simplest solution is to restart the computer and start this version of Wasabi. 

We live in an Orwellian surveillance society where your information is being used to typecast and manipulate you. Bitcoin projects are being pressured to collect more and more data, if possible.
This is why Wasabi Wallet is programmed to be a zero-knowledge software. Developers do not and never will collect any information about you. What you do with your bitcoin is your business.

- **OPEN SOURCE**: Wasabi Wallet is a [free, open-source](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi) and [deterministically reproducible](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/Guides/DeterministicBuildGuide.md) software. Anyone can see, verify and even contribute to the code.

- **TRUSTLESS BY DESIGN**: The software is designed so that neither the public nor the developers can breach your privacy. This is done through [coinjoins](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/), [client-side block filtering](https://nopara73.medium.com/bitcoin-core-vs-wasabi-wallet-network-level-privacy-bdca1d501387) and communication over the [Tor anonymity network.](https://www.torproject.org/)

- **NON-CUSTODIAL**: Not your keys, not your coins. Wasabi Wallet lets you control your private keys, offering you true financial self sovereignty.

- **EASY TO USE**: Wasabi is designed to be a [user friendly](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228348285_Anonymity_loves_company_Usability_and_the_network_effect) Bitcoin wallet, that handles its users' privacy automatically under the hood, including network connections, [input](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction#Input) selection and conjoining.

- **COMPREHENSIVE**: The wallet uses [WabiSabi](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/), an anonymous credential scheme that was designed to enable more accessible and efficient coinjoins. It allows users to utilize the best privacy tool without requiring a large amount of bitcoin in the wallet.

- **AFFORDABLE**: Coinjoining coins with a value above 0.01 BTC costs 0.3% as a [coordinator](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/tree/master/WalletWasabi.Backend) fee + [mining fees](https://mempool.space/). Inputs of 0.01 BTC or below don't pay coordinator fees, nor remixes, even after one transaction. Thus, a payment made with coinjoined funds allows the sender and the recipient to remix their coins without paying any coordinator fees.

    <link href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/releases/tag/v0.11.2"/>
    <summary>This is a minor release, highly recommended, which fixes several problems with the v0.11 (and v0.11.1) releases:

* Unwanted unilateral closes with LND.  v0.11 removed logic to downgrade errors, and this reintroduces it when LND sends &quot;internal error&quot; as the reason for an error (which it seems to do often, but recovers).
* Two more occasional crashes fixed with reconnection logic.
* connectd large memory usage and large CPU usage reduced significantly.
* &quot;Could not load channels from the database&quot; failure on startup fixed, when we had old TORv2 addresses in the database.
* Two fixes to pay/routefinding code, for better payment success.

Thanks to all the people who reported bugs!

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.15.0-beta"/>
    <summary># Database Migrations

There is one database migration for this version in lnd: two new accounting related fields are added to the open channel information. This migration enables a 95% reduction in the disk space consumed by new channel updates. See the [release notes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/release-notes/release-notes-0.15.0.md) for more information.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/master/scripts/keys/roasbeef.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.15.0-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.15.0-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.15.0-beta.sig manifest-v0.15.0-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Thu Jun 23 14:50:22 2022 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.15.0-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.15.0-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.15.0-beta.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.18.2`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `neutrinorpc`, `routerrpc`, `watchtowerrpc`, `monitoring`, `peersrpc`, `kvdb_postrgres`, and `kvdb_etcd`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.15.0-beta
gpg: Signature made Thu 23 Jun 2022 05:39:31 PM UTC using RSA key ID 9B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot;
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.15.0-beta /verify-install.sh v0.15.0-beta
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.15.0-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.15.0-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.15.0-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.15.0-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

    <summary># Binaries

There are two types of binaries:

## Specter Desktop
It's a windowed GUI application with Specter server included.
Supported platforms: [Windows](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/download/v1.10.3/Specter-Setup-v1.10.3.exe), [MacOS](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/download/v1.10.3/Specter-v1.10.3.dmg), [Linux (x86_64)](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/download/v1.10.3/specter_desktop-v1.10.3-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz)

**Note on Linux**: you need to set up udev rules (included in the archive). Check out [readme](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/blob/master/udev/README.md#usage).

**Note on macOS**: The current build supports only macOS Catalina (10.15) or higher. If you'd like to run Specter on an older macOS version, you can [install Specter from Pip](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop#installing-specter-from-pip).

## specterd
It's a command-line program that only runs Specter server.
Supported platforms: [Windows](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/download/v1.10.3/specterd-v1.10.3-win64.zip), [MacOS](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/download/v1.10.3/specterd-v1.10.3-osx.zip), [Linux (x86_64)](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/releases/download/v1.10.3/specterd-v1.10.3-x86_64-linux-gnu.zip)

    <link href="https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.9.2"/>
    <summary>**A newer version is already available! Please don’t use this version anymore.**

This is a hotfix release that adds the latest Tor version (v0.4.7.7) on top of v1.9.1 to improve connectivity caused by an ongoing DDoS attack on the Tor network.

For more details please see https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/milestone/72.

Here are the release notes from v1.9.1:

## Release notes
If you ever wanted to integrate Bisq into your project and/or to automate your most common use cases, now is the time to do it! This release ships an official API: a daemon (GRPC API endpoints) and a CLI. Please see the API section below for more details.

Aside from an API, we have simplified Bisq's navigation to make it easier to find what you are looking for:
* If you want to buy Bitcoin with EUR, just go to Buy &gt; Bitcoin and select your preferred payment method
* If you want to buy BSQ, just go to Buy &gt; BSQ

This approach gets rid of several intervening and (sometimes unintuitive) steps, so we hope it makes Bisq less mind-bending for new users.

And of course there are lots of bug fixes and improvements across the board.

### New Assets
No new assets were added.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.9.2.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.9.2-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.9.2.jar.txt file.

There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.9.2.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 15.0.6 and the v1.9.2 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.

## API
[API]: #api-documentation
Starting with v1.9.0 you can use pre-built versions of the Bisq cli (bisq-cli-v1.9.2.zip) and Bisq daemon (bisq-daemon-v1.9.2.zip) to use Bisq without touching the user interface.

Just download the archives and extract them locally. You have to run the daemon to access the local Bisq daemon API endpoints.

To run daemon.jar on Mainnet:
```bash
$ java -jar daemon.jar --apiPassword=becareful
```

If you just want to control your headless daemon within your terminal you have to run the Bisq cli as well.

Again just download the bisq-cli archive and extract it locally.

To call getversion from cli.jar
```bash
$ java -jar cli.jar --password=becareful getversion
```

You can use the Bisq API to access local Bisq daemon API endpoints, which provide a subset of the Bisq Desktop application's feature set: check balances, transfer BTC and BSQ, create payment accounts, view offers, create and take offers, and execute trades.

The Bisq API is based on the gRPC framework, and any supported gRPC language binding can be used to call Bisq API endpoints.

You'll find in-depth documentation and examples under following link: https://bisq-network.github.io/slate/#introduction

Bisq gRPC API reference documentation example source code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-api-reference. Java and Python developers interested in bot development may find this Intellij project useful for running the existing examples, and writing their own bots.

For additional developer support please join [Development - Bisq v1](https://matrix.to/#/%23bisq.dev:bitcoin.kyoto) on Matrix.

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.9.2.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/releases/tag/1.9.2"/>
    <summary># 1.9.2

This release is backwards compatible with the 1.9.2 release of bitcoin-s

See the individual module sections for more information on lower level updates to the codebase.

Want to get started quickly? See our `docker-compose.yml` file. [See instructions here](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/#docker)

If you are a typescript developer, [you can access the backend via our typescript library](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s-ts)

## Running bitcoin-s

If you want to run the standalone server binary, after verifying gpg signatures, you
can `unzip bitcoin-s-server-1.9.2.zip` and then run it with `chmod +x ./bin/bitcoin-s-server &amp;&amp; ./bin/bitcoin-s-server` to start the node. You will need to
configure the node properly first, you can find example
configurations [here](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/config/configuration#example-configuration-file).

You can then unzip the `bitcoin-s-cli-1.9.2.zip` folder and start using the `bitcoin-s-cli` like this:

```bashrc
./bin/bitcoin-s-cli --help
Usage: bitcoin-s-cli [options] [&lt;cmd&gt;]

  -n, --network &lt;value&gt;    Select the active network.
  --debug                  Print debugging information
  --rpcport &lt;value&gt;        The port to send our rpc request to on the server
  -h, --help               Display this help message and exit
```

For more information on what commands `bitcoin-s-cli` supports check the documentation, here is where to
start: https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/applications/server#server-endpoints

## Verifying signatures

This release is signed with [Chris's signing key](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/security#disclosure) with
fingerprint `9234F4D6AF47C71B741A390F8976CA0AF71A7A2A`

To do the verification, first hash the executable using `sha256sum`. You should check that the result is listed in
the `SHA256SUMS.asc` file next to its file name. After doing that you can use `gpg --verify` to authenticate the
signature.

Example:
```
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
gpg: Signature made Thu 16 Jun 2022 06:34:05 PM CDT
gpg:                using RSA key 9234F4D6AF47C71B741A390F8976CA0AF71A7A2A
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Chris Stewart &lt;stewart.chris1234@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]

$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped

# Executive Summary

## app commons

Adds the ability to stream logs from a process (such as tor) to our `bitcoin-s.log` file.

488716d10a Add ProcessLogger to ProcessBuilder so that we capture logs from binaries like tor (#4327)

## App server

Improves logging capability, we will now cap log files at 100MB and roll over to a new one.
The old file will be archived and compressed. The total archive size for log files is capped at 5GB.

This release also improves startup time of the backend by decoupling binding of the http server &amp; tor startup.\

Finally, in some cases on raspberry pi's bitcoind can drop blocks and need to re-sync.
This release implements logic to retry connecting to bitcoind with an exponential backoff.

## bitcoind rpc

## bundle

The bundle will be removed in future releases. 
We are implementing a new electron GUI, it can be found here: https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s-ts

## Build

The major improvement this release is integrating [jlink](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/jlink.html)
`jlink` allows you to ship with a custom JRE in the application you ship so the user doesn't need to download Java.

There is some caveats to using `jlink` on arm64 machines, see #4383.

cbeae5cdbc Remove carve out for protoc on aarch64 now that the akka grpc plugin has been updated (#4384)

## Core

Begins laying the ground work for Taproot by including the `XOnlyPubKey` data structure.

Adds various TLVs defined in BOLT14.

Finally fixes various bugs and improves ergonomics of the core library.

## Crypto

Rework how `HashType` is handled in the `ECDigitalSignature` API.
Previously it was extremely confusing whether an `ECDigitalSiganture` had a `HashType` or not.
Now you can call `ECDigitalSignature.hashTypeOpt` to determine if the signature has a `HashType`.

b80bf4649e Add HashType to ECDigitalSignature API (#4320)
f42d7ae8e7 Added validation to signature methods to avoid corruption edge cases (#4214)

## DLC node

272f31aeaa Fix race condition on DLC node startup wrt to tor (#4335)

## DLC wallet

This release of the DLC wallet introduces the concept of `Contacts`. 
These are people you are frequently doing DLCs so we should save their information to make it easier to enter
into a new DLC with that same contact.

This PR also adds a mapping between DLCs in the wallet and the contact you are doing the DLC with.
Now the contact information will be shown by the DLC so you can remember who you did the DLC with.

Adds tor endpoints for the Suredbits Oracle Explorer so you can send announcements/attestations directly to the hidden service.

c9502babba Tor endpoints for the oracle explorer client (#4314)

## wallet

This release fixes a bug where we could create a duplicate UTXO in the wallet.
If this bug is detected in the wallet, this will trigger a rescan on wallet startup to correct wallet state.

This also fixes a bug in our sql queries where we fetch too many outpoints at one time for a block.
This resulted in a SQL exception. Now we break the query up into smaller queries.

    <summary># Summary

_PRIVACY IS YOUR ABILITY TO SELECTIVELY REVEAL YOURSELF TO THE WORLD_

We live in an Orwellian surveillance society where your information is being used to typecast and manipulate you. Bitcoin projects are being pressured to collect more and more data, if possible.
This is why Wasabi Wallet is programmed to be a zero-knowledge software. Developers do not and never will collect any information about you. What you do with your bitcoin is your business.

- **OPEN SOURCE**: Wasabi Wallet is a [free, open-source](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi) and [deterministically reproducible](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/Guides/DeterministicBuildGuide.md) software. Anyone can see, verify and even contribute to the code.

- **TRUSTLESS BY DESIGN**: The software is designed so that neither the public nor the developers can breach your privacy. This is done through [coinjoins](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/), [client-side block filtering](https://nopara73.medium.com/bitcoin-core-vs-wasabi-wallet-network-level-privacy-bdca1d501387) and communication over the [Tor anonymity network.](https://www.torproject.org/)

- **NON-CUSTODIAL**: Not your keys, not your coins. Wasabi Wallet lets you control your private keys, offering you true financial self sovereignty.

- **EASY TO USE**: Wasabi is designed to be a [user friendly](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228348285_Anonymity_loves_company_Usability_and_the_network_effect) Bitcoin wallet, that handles its users' privacy automatically under the hood, including network connections, [input](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction#Input) selection and conjoining.

- **COMPREHENSIVE**: The wallet uses [WabiSabi](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/), an anonymous credential scheme that was designed to enable more accessible and efficient coinjoins. It allows users to utilize the best privacy tool without requiring a large amount of bitcoin in the wallet.

- **AFFORDABLE**: Coinjoining coins with a value above 0.01 BTC costs 0.3% as a [coordinator](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/tree/master/WalletWasabi.Backend) fee + [mining fees](https://mempool.space/). Inputs of 0.01 BTC or below don't pay coordinator fees, nor remixes, even after one transaction. Thus, a payment made with coinjoined funds allows the sender and the recipient to remix their coins without paying any coordinator fees.

# Newbie Guide

While setting up Wasabi is straightforward, even a Linux wizard with the longest beard can get stuck on the most basic tasks. Consider taking a look at the [How To Use](https://youtu.be/bQKU2khua-8) guide.

# Advanced Guide

If you want to build Wasabi from source code or update the source code check out [these instructions.](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/BuildSource.html)

From version 1.1.3 Wasabi also introduces [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/): [Deterministic Build Guide](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/Guides/DeterministicBuildGuide.md)

Build with .NET 6.0.300.

## FAQ

- **Frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/discussions/categories/faq).**
- **Requirements?** x64, Linux, &gt;Win10, &gt;macOS 10.15.

## Release Notes

- Brand new considerations to improve the user experience. Receive, wait, spend. Privately, by default. 
- Easy to install, easy to use. 
- New UI made with love using [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI) framework.
- A new coinjoin protocol called WabiSabi. See the research paper [here](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi).

This release introduces many cool new features:

* All-new mining dashboard with 7 new mining graphs
* Added &quot;bitfeed style&quot; mempool block visualization
* Improved blocks page that identifies mining pools
* Improved fee suggestions with a &quot;no priority&quot; rate
* And much more!

Out of the ~3400 commits in our git repo, ~1300 were made since v2.3.
Lots of work went into v2.4, and all users are encouraged to upgrade to enjoy this new functionality.

## Notes for upgrading from v2.3 if your timezone is NOT set to UTC

If you are upgrading from v2.3 or earlier and you want to migrate your historical mempool statistics database, you will need to do a special update procedure **if your server's timezone is NOT set to UTC**. How to migrate:

1) Backup your MySQL database.
2) Terminate the mempool backend process.
3) Run the following query to check your mysql connection timezone: `SELECT @@global.time_zone, @@session.time_zone;`
4) If you get SYSTEM, check your system timezone with the `date` command.
5) Perform the SQL query with your negative GMT offset: `UPDATE statistics SET added=DATE_ADD(added, INTERVAL -2 HOUR);` (For example, if your timezone is set to CEST (UTC+2), you need to shift all your statistics entries negative 2 hours.)
6) Proceed with upgrading mempool as usual.

## API Updates
 * Channels larger than 16777215 sats (Wumbo!) are now supported and can be
   enabled for inbound channels using
   `ChannelHandshakeLimits::max_funding_satoshis` (#1425).
 * Support for feature `option_zeroconf`, allowing immediate forwarding of
   payments after channel opening. This is configured for outbound channels
   using `ChannelHandshakeLimits::trust_own_funding_0conf` whereas
   `ChannelManager::accept_inbound_channel_from_trusted_peer_0conf` has to be
   used for accepting inbound channels (#1401, #1505).
 * `ChannelManager::claim_funds` no longer returns a `bool` to indicate success.
   Instead, an `Event::PaymentClaimed` is generated if the claim was successful.
   Likewise, `ChannelManager::fail_htlc_backwards` no longer has a return value
   (#1434).
 * `lightning-rapid-gossip-sync` is a new crate for syncing gossip data from a
   server, primarily aimed at mobile devices (#1155).
 * `RapidGossipSync` can be passed to `BackgroundProcessor` in order to persist
   the `NetworkGraph` and handle `NetworkUpdate`s during event handling (#1433,
   #1517).
 * `NetGraphMsgHandler` has been renamed to `P2PGossipSync`, the `network_graph`
    module has been renamed to `gossip`, and `NetworkUpdate::ChannelClosed` has
   been renamed `NetworkUpdate::ChannelFailure` (#1159).
 * Added a `filtered_block_connected` method to `chain::Listen` and a default
   implementation of `block_connected` for those fetching filtered instead of
   full blocks (#1453).
 * The `lightning-block-sync` crate's `BlockSource` trait methods now take
   `&amp;self` instead of `&amp;mut self` (#1307).
 * `inbound_payment` module is now public to allow for creating invoices without
   a `ChannelManager` (#1384).
 * `lightning-block-sync`'s `init` and `poll` modules support `&amp;dyn BlockSource`
   which can be determined at runtime (#1423).
 * `lightning-invoice` crate's `utils` now accept an expiration time (#1422,
   #1474).
 * `Event::PaymentForwarded` includes `prev_channel_id` and `next_channel_id`
   (#1419, #1475).
 * `chain::Watch::release_pending_monitor_events`' return type now associates
   `MonitorEvent`s with funding `OutPoints` (#1475).
 * `lightning-background-processor` crate's `Persister` trait has been moved to
   `lightning` crate's `util::persist` module, which now has a general
   `KVStorePersister` trait. Blanket implementations of `Persister` and
   `chainmonitor::Persist` are given for types implementing `KVStorePersister`.
   ` lightning-persister`'s `FilesystemPersister` implements `KVStorePersister`
   (#1417).
 * `ChannelDetails` and `ChannelCounterparty` include fields for HTLC minimum
   and maximum values (#1378).
 * Added a `max_inbound_htlc_value_in_flight_percent_of_channel` field to
   `ChannelHandshakeConfig`, capping the total value of outstanding inbound
   HTLCs for a channel (#1444).
 * `ProbabilisticScorer` is parameterized by a `Logger`, which it uses to log
   channel liquidity updates or lack thereof (#1405).
 * `ChannelDetails` has an `outbound_htlc_limit_msat` field, which should be
   used in routing instead of `outbound_capacity_msat` (#1435).
 * `ProbabilisticScorer`'s channel liquidities can be logged via
   `debug_log_liquidity_stats` (#1460).
 * `BackgroundProcessor` now takes an optional `WriteableScore` which it will
   persist using the `Persister` trait's new `persist_scorer` method (#1416).
 * Upgraded to `bitcoin` crate version 0.28.1 (#1389).
 * `ShutdownScript::new_witness_program` now takes a `WitnessVersion` instead of
   a `NonZeroU8` (#1389).
 * Channels will no longer be automatically force closed when the counterparty
   is disconnected due to incompatibility (#1429).
 * `ChannelManager` methods for funding, accepting, and closing channels now
   take a `counterparty_node_id` parameter, which has also been added as a field
   to `Event::FundingGenerationReady` (#1479, #1485).
 * `InvoicePayer::new` now takes a `Retry` enum (replacing the `RetryAttempts`
   struct), which supports both attempt- and timeout-based retrying (#1418).
 * `Score::channel_penalty_msat` takes a `ChannelUsage` struct, which contains
   the capacity as an `EffectiveCapacity` enum and any potential in-flight HTLC
   value, rather than a single `u64`. Used by `ProbabilisticScorer` for more
   accurate penalties (#1456).
 * `build_route_from_hops` is a new function useful for constructing a `Route`
   given a specific list of public keys (#1491).
 * `FundingLocked` message has been renamed `ChannelReady`, and related
   identifiers have been renamed accordingly (#1506).
 * `core2::io` or `std::io` (depending on feature flags `no-std` or `std`) is
   exported as a `lightning::io` module (#1504).
 * The deprecated `Scorer` has been removed in favor or `ProbabilisticScorer`
   (#1512).

## Performance Improvements
 * `lightning-persister` crate's `FilesystemPersister` is faster by 15x (#1404).
 * Log gossip query messages at `GOSSIP` instead of `TRACE` to avoid
   overwhelming default logging (#1421).
 * `PeerManager` supports processing messages from different peers in parallel,
   and this is taken advantage of in gossip processing (#1023).
 * Greatly reduced per-channel and per-node memory usage due to upgrade of
   `secp256k1` crate to 0.22.1 and `bitcoin` crate to 0.28.1
 * Reduced per-peer memory usage in `PeerManager` (#1472).

## Spec Compliance
 * `find_route` now assumes variable-length onions by default for nodes where
   support for the feature is unknown (#1414).
 * A `warn` message is now sent when receiving a `channel_reestablish` with an
   old commitment transaction number rather than immediately force-closing the
   channel (#1430).
 * When a `channel_update` message is included in an onion error's `failuremsg`,
   its message type is now encoded. Reading such messages is also supported
   (#1465).

## Bug Fixes
 * Fixed a bug where crashing while persisting a `ChannelMonitorUpdate` for a
   part of a multi-path payment could cause loss of funds due to a partial
   payment claim on restart (#1434).
 * `BackgroundProcessor` has been fixed to improve serialization reliability on
   slow systems which can avoid force-closes (#1436).
 * `gossip_timestamp_filter` filters are now honored when sending gossip to
   peers (#1452).
 * During a reorg, only force-close a channel if its funding transaction is
   unconfirmed rather than as it loses confirmations (#1461).
 * Fixed a rare panic in `lightning-net-tokio` when fetching a peer's socket
   address after the connection has been closed caused by a race condition
   (#1449).
 * `find_route` will no longer return routes that would cause onion construction
   to fail in some cases (#1476).
 * `ProbabilisticScorer` uses more precision when approximating `log10` (#1406).

## Serialization Compatibility
 * All above new events/fields are ignored by prior clients. All above new
   events/fields are not present when reading objects serialized by prior
   versions of the library.
 * `ChannelManager` serialization is no longer compatible with versions prior to
   0.0.99 (#1401).
 * Channels with `option_zeroconf` feature enabled (not required for 0-conf
   channel use) will be unreadable by versions prior to 0.0.107 (#1401, #1505).

    <summary>This is a minor release, highly recommended, which fixes two problems with the v0.11.0.1 release:

1. Unwanted unilateral closes.  We could get confused by reconnections, and think that a peer had sent us out-of-date &quot;channel_reestablish&quot; data.  This caused us to complain about e.g. &quot;bad reestablish revocation_number: 7457 vs 7462&quot; and send an error and close the channel.
2. An overzealous check in `connectd`, particularly when reconnecting with multiple channels, which intermittently crashed the node.

Thanks to all the people who reported bugs!

    <link href="https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/releases/tag/v1.9.1"/>
    <summary>**A newer version is already available! Please don’t use this version anymore.**

This is a follow-up release that fixes a null pointer exception when resolving a mediation with custom payout, fixes an API issue with AustrialianPayId and improves fee transaction validation.

See https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/milestone/70?closed=1 for more details.

Here are the release notes from v1.9.0:

## Release notes
If you ever wanted to integrate Bisq into your project and/or to automate your most common use cases, now is the time to do it! This release ships an official API: a daemon (GRPC API endpoints) and a CLI. Please see the API section below for more details.

Aside from an API, we have simplified Bisq's navigation to make it easier to find what you are looking for:
* If you want to buy Bitcoin with EUR, just go to Buy &gt; Bitcoin and select your preferred payment method
* If you want to buy BSQ, just go to Buy &gt; BSQ

This approach gets rid of several intervening and (sometimes unintuitive) steps, so we hope it makes Bisq less mind-bending for new users.

And of course there are lots of bug fixes and improvements across the board.

### New Assets
No new assets were added.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.9.1.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.9.1-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.9.1.jar.txt file.

There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.9.1.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 15.0.6 and the v1.9.1 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.

## API
[API]: #api-documentation
Starting with v1.9.1 you can use pre-built versions of the Bisq cli (bisq-cli-v1.9.1.zip) and Bisq daemon (bisq-daemon-v1.9.1.zip) to use Bisq without touching the user interface.

Just download the archives and extract them locally. You have to run the daemon to access the local Bisq daemon API endpoints.

To run daemon.jar on Mainnet:
```bash
$ java -jar daemon.jar --apiPassword=becareful
```

If you just want to control your headless daemon within your terminal you have to run the Bisq cli as well.

Again just download the bisq-cli archive and extract it locally.

To call getversion from cli.jar
```bash
$ java -jar cli.jar --password=becareful getversion
```

You can use the Bisq API to access local Bisq daemon API endpoints, which provide a subset of the Bisq Desktop application's feature set: check balances, transfer BTC and BSQ, create payment accounts, view offers, create and take offers, and execute trades.

The Bisq API is based on the gRPC framework, and any supported gRPC language binding can be used to call Bisq API endpoints.

You'll find in-depth documentation and examples under following link: https://bisq-network.github.io/slate/#introduction

Bisq gRPC API reference documentation example source code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq-api-reference. Java and Python developers interested in bot development may find this Intellij project useful for running the existing examples, and writing their own bots.

For additional developer support please join [Development - Bisq v1](https://matrix.to/#/%23bisq.dev:bitcoin.kyoto) on Matrix.

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.9.1.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/releases/tag/v0.11.0.1"/>
    <summary>We're pleased to announce the 0.11.0 release of c-lightning, named on behalf of @SimonVrouwe.

This release is the first under the rebranded &quot;Core Lightning&quot; name.
(Note: binaries are labelled v0.11.0.1 due to a minor bugfix required for reproducible builds).

## Highlights for Users

* We now finally support multiple live channels to the same peer!
* If we detect rust support, we'll build the `cln-grpc` plugin for full native GRPC support.
* We advertize an external IP address if it's reported by two or more peers (`disable-ip-discovery` or `always-use-proxy` disables).
* You can specify two databases with --wallet, and we'll write to both at once (sqlite3 only).
* `pay` supports BOLT 11 payment metadata: we'll send it if it's in the invoice.
* New `setchannel` command (deprecates `setchannelfee`) allows setting max and min HTLC amounts.  Try `lightning-cli setchannel all 0` for #zerobasefee.
* `pay` can be forced to exclude channels or nodes with the `exclude` 
* Significant speedup in start times for old nodes with many historical HTLCs.

# Highlights for the Network

* We send the remote node's IP address in the `init` message, so they can tell what it is. (https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/917)
* We are more aggressive in sending our own gossip to peers, to help propagation.
* Default port is set by network, so regtest and testnet defaults are different. (https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/968)
* We never generate legacy onions, it's always TLV.  We still forward legacy onions for now.
* We flush sockets before closing, so errors are more likely to reach the peer.
* Experimental support for announcing DNS addresses in node_announcement (https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/911)

 
# Highlights for Developers

* `pay` has a `maxfee` parameter, which sets a simple LND-style upper fee (vs using `maxfeepercent` and `exemptfee`)
* You can create invoices with only a description hash, using `deschashonly`.  We still store the full description, so use restraint!
* `pay` has deprecated paying solely by description hash: you should provide the full description, too.
* `delinvoice` has a new `desconly` parameter to simply trim the descriptions, but leave the rest intact.
* We have a rust crate `cln-rpc` to easily interact with our JSON-RPC.
* `msggen` tool allows easy generation of language bindings for our JSON RPC interface.

More details can be found in the changelog.

Thanks to everyone for their contributions and bug reports; please keep them coming.

Since 0.10.2, we've had 712 commits from 37 different authors over 170 days.

    <id>https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.14.3-beta</id>
    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.14.3-beta"/>
    <summary>This is the third, and final (?) minor release of the v0.14.x series! This release contains only a series of bug fixes, and doesn't introduce any backwards compatible changes (database migrations, etc) from the prior version. Notable fixes in this release include: a fix to an invoice registry related deadlock, a fix for an edge case when running the remote signer operating mode, and a fix to ensure that 3rd parties sweeping an anchor UTXO doesn't lead to the wallet having a fragmented internal UTXO state, and a fix for a payment state inconsistency (a payment looks like it was stuck though no HTLCs exist).


# Database Migrations
This release contains no database migrations. 

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/master/scripts/keys/roasbeef.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.14.3-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.14.3-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.14.3-beta.sig manifest-v0.14.3-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Mon Apr 18 13:26:47 2022 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.14.3-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.14.3-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.14.3-beta.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.17.3`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, `watchtowerrpc` and `monitoring`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.14.3-beta
gpg: Signature made Mon Apr 18 11:15:09 2022 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.14.3-beta /verify-install.sh v0.14.3-beta
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.14.3-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.14.3-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.14.3-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.14.3-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

    <link href="https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/releases/tag/1.9.1"/>
    <summary># 1.9.1

This release is backwards compatible with the 1.9.0 release of bitcoin-s

See the individual module sections for more information on lower level updates to the codebase.

A major developer UX improvement we had since this release is the ability for a developer to spin up a docker environment for the DLC wallet easily. [See instructions here](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/#docker)

If you are a typescript developer, [you can access the backend via our typescript library](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s-ts)

## Running bitcoin-s

If you want to run the standalone server binary, after verifying gpg signatures, you
can `unzip bitcoin-s-server-1.9.1.zip` and then run it with `chmod +x ./bin/bitcoin-s-server &amp;&amp; ./bin/bitcoin-s-server` to start the node. You will need to
configure the node properly first, you can find example
configurations [here](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/config/configuration#example-configuration-file).

You can then unzip the `bitcoin-s-cli-1.9.1.zip` folder and start using the `bitcoin-s-cli` like this:

```bashrc
./bin/bitcoin-s-cli --help
Usage: bitcoin-s-cli [options] [&lt;cmd&gt;]

  -n, --network &lt;value&gt;    Select the active network.
  --debug                  Print debugging information
  --rpcport &lt;value&gt;        The port to send our rpc request to on the server
  -h, --help               Display this help message and exit
```

For more information on what commands `bitcoin-s-cli` supports check the documentation, here is where to
start: https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/applications/server#server-endpoints

## Verifying signatures

This release is signed with [Chris's signing key](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/security#disclosure) with
fingerprint `9234F4D6AF47C71B741A390F8976CA0AF71A7A2A`

To do the verification, first hash the executable using `sha256sum`. You should check that the result is listed in
the `SHA256SUMS.asc` file next to its file name. After doing that you can use `gpg --verify` to authenticate the
signature.

Example:

```
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
gpg: Signature made Mon 18 Apr 2022 02:19:54 PM CDT
gpg:                using RSA key 9234F4D6AF47C71B741A390F8976CA0AF71A7A2A
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Chris Stewart &lt;stewart.chris1234@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]

$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped                                                                                            
bitcoin-s_1.9.1-1_amd64.deb: OK
bitcoin-s-1.9.1.dmg: OK
bitcoin-s-bundle.msi: OK
bitcoin-s-cli-x86_64-apple-darwin: OK
bitcoin-s-cli-x86_64-pc-linux: OK
bitcoin-s-server-1.9.1.zip: OK

# Executive Summary

- Implements `sendoffer` so you now can send a DLC offer to a peer
- Implements the DLC mailbox to allow aggregation of messages such as `sendoffer` from your peer
- Allow DLC payouts to an external address not in the bitcoin-s wallet
- Only sync compact filters since wallet's creation time. This reduces IBD significantly and saves 13GB in disk space.
- Improving the windows installation experience

## App server

The major feature this release is adding mempool support when bitcoind is as a backend. Now our wallet
will be informed of transactions relevant to the wallet that are in the mempool.

This release also reworks the label APIs in the wallet to make them easier to use.

Finally we expose the `offer-send` RPC so you can progmatically send an offer to another DLC wallet.

## DLC node

The major feature this release is the offer inbox. This allows a counterparty to send you
and offer for a DLC. Next time you open up your wallet, you can see offers that were sent to you
and decide to accept them or put them in the trash.

## DLC wallet

The theme for this release was making database operations transactional to avoid corrupt wallet states.

We also included a new state for computing adaptor signatures. This can take signficant time on low resource
devices such as a raspberry pi. The new state `AdaptorSigComputationState` can now be used by UI developers
to signal to the user their DLC is in progress, specifically computing signatures.

The last feature is adding the ability to specify external payout addresses for a wallet to receive DLC payouts.
We plan on using this at Bitcoin 2022 in Miami to allow for users to receive payouts from a esports gaming DLC.

## node

Only sync compact filters since wallet's creation time. This reduces IBD sigficantly and saves 13GB in disk space.
As a datapoint, for a wallet created in May of 2019 it takes ~50 minutes to do IBD. For a new wallet it takes 30 minutes.

This increases the IBD for a new wallet by 90% giving a much better UX. If you want to sync all compact filters from genesis,
the only way to currently do this is adjusting `creationTime` to be an older timestamp inside of the seed file found at
`$HOME/.bitcoin-s/seeds/encrypted-bitcoin-s-seed.json` by default.

    <summary>## API Updates
 * Minimum supported rust version (MSRV) is now 1.41.1 (#1310).
 * Lightning feature `option_scid_alias` is now supported and may be negotiated
   when opening a channel with a peer. It can be configured via
   `ChannelHandshakeConfig::negotiate_scid_privacy` and is off by default but
   will be on by default in the future (#1351).
 * `OpenChannelRequest` now has a `channel_type` field indicating the features
   the channel will operate with and should be used to filter channels with
   undesirable features (#1351). See the Serialization Compatibility section.
 * `ChannelManager` supports sending and receiving short channel id aliases in
   the `funding_locked` message. These are used when forwarding payments and
   constructing invoice route hints for improved privacy. `ChannelDetails` has a
   `inbound_scid_alias` field and a `get_inbound_payment_scid` method to support
   the latter (#1311).
 * `DefaultRouter` and `find_route` take an additional random seed to improve
   privacy by adding a random CLTV expiry offset to each path's final hop. This
   helps obscure the intended recipient from adversarial intermediate hops
   (#1286). The seed is  also used to randomize candidate paths during route
   selection (#1359).
 * The `lightning-block-sync` crate's `init::synchronize_listeners` method
   interface has been relaxed to support multithreaded environments (#1349).
 * `ChannelManager::create_inbound_payment_for_hash`'s documentation has been
   corrected to remove the one-year restriction on `invoice_expiry_delta_secs`,
   which is only applicable to the deprecated `create_inbound_payment_legacy`
   and `create_inbound_payment_for_hash_legacy` methods (#1341).
 * `Features` mutator methods now take `self` by reference instead of by value
   (#1331).
 * The CLTV of the last hop in a path is now included when comparing against
   `RouteParameters::max_total_cltv_expiry_delta` (#1358).
 * Invoice creation functions in `lightning-invoice` crate's `utils` module
   include versions that accept a description hash instead of only a description
   (#1361).
 * `RoutingMessageHandler::sync_routing_table` has been renamed `peer_connected`
   (#1368).
 * `MessageSendEvent::SendGossipTimestampFilter` has been added to indicate that
   a `gossip_timestamp_filter` should be sent (#1368).
 * `PeerManager` takes an optional `NetAddress` in `new_outbound_connection` and
   `new_inbound_connection`, which is used to report back the remote address to
   the connecting peer in the `init` message (#1326).
 * `ChannelManager::accept_inbound_channel` now takes a `user_channel_id`, which
   is used in a similar manner as in outbound channels. (#1381).
 * `BackgroundProcessor` now persists `NetworkGraph` on a timer and upon
   shutdown as part of a new `Persister` trait, which also includes
   `ChannelManager` persistence (#1376).
 * `ProbabilisticScoringParameters` now has a `base_penalty_msat` option, which
   default to 500 msats. It is applied at each hop to help avoid longer paths
   (#1375).
 * `ProbabilisticScoringParameters::liquidity_penalty_multiplier_msat`'s default
   value is now 40,000 msats instead of 10,000 msats (#1375).
 * The `lightning` crate has a `grind_signatures` feature used to produce
   signatures with low r-values for more predictable transaction weight. This
   feature is on by default (#1388).
 * `ProbabilisticScoringParameters` now has a `amount_penalty_multiplier_msat`
   option, which is used to further penalize large amounts (#1399).
 * `PhantomRouteHints`, `FixedPenaltyScorer`, and `ScoringParameters` now
   implement `Clone` (#1346).

## Bug Fixes
 * Fixed a compilation error in `ProbabilisticScorer` under `--feature=no-std`
   (#1347).
 * Invoice creation functions in `lightning-invoice` crate's `utils` module
   filter invoice hints in order to limit the invoice size (#1325).
 * Fixed a bug where a `funding_locked` message was delayed by a block if the
   funding transaction was confirmed while offline, depending on the ordering
   of `Confirm::transactions_confirmed` calls when brought back online (#1363).
 * Fixed a bug in `NetGraphMsgHandler` where it didn't continue to receive
   gossip messages from peers after initial connection (#1368, #1382).
 * `ChannelManager::timer_tick_occurred` will now timeout a received multi-path
   payment (MPP) after three ticks if not received in full instead of waiting
   until near the HTLC timeout block(#1353).
 * Fixed an issue with `find_route` causing it to be overly aggressive in using
   MPP over channels to the same first hop (#1370).
 * Reduced time spent processing `channel_update` messages by checking
   signatures after checking if no newer messages have already been processed
   (#1380).
 * Fixed a few issues in `find_route` which caused preferring paths with a
   higher cost (#1398).
 * Fixed an issue in `ProbabilisticScorer` where a channel with not enough
   liquidity could still be used when retrying a failed payment if it was on a
   path with an overall lower cost (#1399).

## Serialization Compatibility
 * Channels open with `option_scid_alias` negotiated will be incompatible with
   prior releases (#1351). This may occur in the following cases:
   * Outbound channels when `ChannelHandshakeConfig::negotiate_scid_privacy` is
     enabled.
   * Inbound channels when automatically accepted from an `OpenChannel` message
     with a `channel_type` that has `ChannelTypeFeatures::supports_scid_privacy`
     return true. See `UserConfig::accept_inbound_channels`.
   * Inbound channels when manually accepted from an `OpenChannelRequest` with a
     `channel_type` that has `ChannelTypeFeatures::supports_scid_privacy` return
     true. See `UserConfig::manually_accept_inbound_channels`.
