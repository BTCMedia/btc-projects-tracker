    <link href="https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/releases/tag/1.9.0"/>
    <summary># 1.9.0

##  Executive Summary
This release is backwards incompatible with previous releases of bitcoin-s.
You will not be able to build a DLC with prior releases of bitcoin-s. This was due to a bug
in how we computed `contractId` in a DLC. See #4012 for more information.

We now have official typescript bindings for our `oracleServer` and `appServer`

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bitcoin-s-ts/wallet-ts
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bitcoin-s-ts/oracle-server-ts

See the individual module sections for more information on lower level updates to the codebase.

## Running Bitcoin-S

If you want to run the standalone server binary, after verifying gpg signatures, you
can `unzip bitcoin-s-server-1.9.0.zip` and then run it with `./bin/bitcoin-s-server` to start the node. You will need to
configure the node properly first, you can find example
configurations [here](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/config/configuration#example-configuration-file).

You can then unzip the `bitcoin-s-cli-1.9.0.zip` folder and start using the `bitcoin-s-cli` like this:

```bashrc
./bin/bitcoin-s-cli --help
Usage: bitcoin-s-cli [options] [&lt;cmd&gt;]

  -n, --network &lt;value&gt;    Select the active network.
  --debug                  Print debugging information
  --rpcport &lt;value&gt;        The port to send our rpc request to on the server
  -h, --help               Display this help message and exit
```

For more information on what commands `bitcoin-s-cli` supports check the documentation, here is where to
start: https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/applications/server#server-endpoints

## Verifying signatures

This release is signed with [Chris's signing key](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/security#disclosure) with
fingerprint `339A49229576050819083EB3F99724872F822910`

To do the verification, first hash the executable using `sha256sum`. You should check that the result is listed in
the `SHA256SUMS.asc` file next to its file name. After doing that you can use `gpg --verify` to authenticate the
signature.

Example:

```
sha256sum bitcoin-s-server-1.9.0.zip
ec2bccd61bdabc1f0453d1f8b7608b628da28fe45d55754a269e30391106c18d  bitcoin-s-server-1.9.0.zip

gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
gpg: Signature made Tue 15 Feb 2022 12:58:48 PM CST
gpg:                using RSA key 339A49229576050819083EB3F99724872F822910
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Chris Stewart &lt;stewart.chris1234@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 339A 4922 9576 0508 1908  3EB3 F997 2487 2F82 2910

## App server

The major features shipped this release is support for websockets.
You can now be notified of websocket events from the wallet, dlc wallet, and chain.
These are used on the [wallet-server-ui](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s-ts/tree/master/wallet-server-ui) to notify when events happen

This module will be renamed to `Wallet Server` in future releases as that
is a more accurate name for this module.

There are various PRs that broke API compatability from `1.8` -&gt; `1.9`. See [the list](https://github.com/bitcoin-s/bitcoin-s/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Aapi-breaking+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A1.9)

## Db commons

A major theme this release is enabling our APIs to use [database actions in Slick](https://scala-slick.org/doc/3.3.3/dbio.html).
This allows us to build database transactions to avoid corrupting data.

We also fixed some bugs in our database implementations around storing very large scriptpubkeys.

## DLC node

The major change this release is implementing a connection timeout for dlc node.
If we cannot connect to a peer within 45 seconds, we throw a timeout exception.

49d4d7f179 2022 02 06 issue 4049 (#4056)
7f344ad3ff 2022 02 06 announcement creation logging (#4055)
524c5212e0 Add MasterXPubTable to list of DLCOracle tables (#3955)
c3d1b2ee12 Give DLCOracle to filter events by pending/completed (#3953)

## DLC wallet

This release of dlc wallet fixes bugs for accepting offers multiple times.

We also add a new column in `global_dlc_data` for `serialization_version` for when we
break binary level serialization in the DLC protocol spec. This will be done in the 2.0
release of bitcoin-s.

Finally there is a ton of improvements to database handling code.

## gui

Small bug fixes. We are moving to having a web interface for bitcoin-s.

This can be found here:

## keymanager

## Lnd rpc

Upgrades lnd to 0.14.2, implements more lnd rpc functionality.

44373f8449 Add functions for LND subscription (#4062)
afc6a32c62 Update lnd to v0.14.2 (#4040)

155301fc1d Allow lnd remote to work with certificate string (#3840)
079fa62073 Lnd v0.14.0 (#3835)

## node

Fixes various bugs around broadcasting witness transactions. Also fixes bugs to make sure
we fetch the entire witness transaction (witnesses included). Previously we wouldn't get the witness
which leads to problems when calculating DLC outcome state.

This release also adds the ability to store peers we see on the p2p network in teh database. Eventually
we will be able to connect to random peers we see on the p2p network rather than just connecting
to the node configured in `bitcoin-s.node.peers`

    <id>https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.14.2-beta</id>
    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.14.2-beta"/>
    <summary>This is the second minor release of the 0.14x cycle! This release contains no new larger/major features, and instead packages up a series of bug fixes (several obscure crash fixes), and enhancements (like begin able to convert a node to a watch-only mode for use with the remote signer feature).

We strongly recommend that all users update!

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/master/scripts/keys/roasbeef.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.14.2-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.14.2-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.14.2-beta.sig manifest-v0.14.2-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Thu Feb  3 13:55:45 2022 PST
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.14.2-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.14.2-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.14.2-beta.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.17.3`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, `watchtowerrpc` and `monitoring`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.14.2-beta
gpg: Signature made Thu 03 Feb 2022 08:21:05 PM UTC using RSA key ID 9B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot;
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.14.2-beta /verify-install.sh v0.14.2-beta
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.14.2-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.14.2-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.14.2-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.14.2-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

    <link href="https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/releases/tag/v0.7.0"/>
    <summary># Eclair v0.7.0

This release adds official support for two long-awaited lightning features: anchor outputs and onion messages.
Support for the PostreSQL database backend is also now production ready!
This release also includes a few bug fixes and many new (smaller) features.
It is fully compatible with 0.6.2 (and all previous versions of eclair).

Because this release changes the default type of channels that your node will use, make sure you read the release notes carefully!
The release notes can be found [here](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/blob/master/docs/release-notes/eclair-v0.7.0.md).

## Verifying signatures

You will need `gpg` and our release signing key 7A73FE77DE2C4027. Note that you can get it:

- from our website: https://acinq.co/pgp/drouinf.asc
- from github user @sstone, a committer on eclair: https://api.github.com/users/sstone/gpg_keys

To import our signing key:

```sh
$ gpg --import drouinf.asc
```

To verify the release file checksums and signatures:

```sh
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped
```

## Building

Eclair builds are deterministic. To reproduce our builds, please use the following environment (*):

- Ubuntu 20.04
- AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.6
- Maven 3.8.1

Use the following command to generate the eclair-node package:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

That should generate `eclair-node/target/eclair-node-0.7.0-a804905-bin.zip` with sha256 checksums that match the one we provide and sign in `SHA256SUMS.asc`

(*) You may be able to build the exact same artefacts with other operating systems or versions of JDK 11, we have not tried everything.

## Upgrading

This release is fully compatible with previous eclair versions. You don't need to close your channels, just stop eclair, upgrade and restart.</summary>

    <summary>BTCPay Server started in August 2017 and meanwhile has been evolving incrementally thanks to the feedback of the community.

It was finally time to cleanup the UI/UX and technical debt we accumulated over the years.

We enumerate here a lot of new features and bug fixes, but we do not enumerate the UI/UX changes, we dedicated a separate [blog post for this topic](https://blog.btcpayserver.org/btcpay-server-1-4-0/).

The heavy lifting of this work has been mainly brought to you thanks to the collaboration of @dstrukt and @dennisreimann.
We thank also all the testers we brought us feedback, and all of you who participated in the weekly design meetings.

The work on the UI/UX is however never over and we will keep on improving it based on your feedback.

Note: If you are using our docker deployment on a raspberry pi 4, there is a small chance your docker version does not support the new docker image.
If you have any issue with raspberry pi 4, you need to update your docker version following steps on [this blog post](https://blog.samcater.com/fix-workaround-rpi4-docker-libseccomp2-docker-20/).
Note that you do not need to update libseccomp2, our update process does this for you automatically.

    <summary>**IMPORTANT:** RSK Testnet consensus rules have changed in this version, and it is not compatible with previous versions (**only for Testnet, this doesn't apply to Mainnet**). If you've been running previous versions of the RSK client node in Testnet, we encourage you to update to this new version. The **Testnet** network upgrade will happen at **block number 2,581,800**. This is a non-mandatory upgrade for RSK Mainnet nodes.

This release contains enhancements to the node's JSON-RPC interface, as well as Ethereum compatibility fixes. It also introduces a consensus change for Testnet that increases the minimum block difficulty and avoids scenarios where a huge number of blocks would be mined in a short period of time if the difficulty dropped to the minimum levels (doesn't apply to Mainnet).

This is a summary of the changes included in this version:

- Improved message queue expiration policy (#1610)
- Added support for `pending` parameter in `eth_getBlockByNumber` JSON-RPC method (#1627)
- JSON-RPC compatibility fixes (#1623, #1629)
- Fixed `eth_isSyncing` method which was not working as expected (#1618)
- Introduced gas exactimation enhancements to the `eth_estimateGas` method (#1548)
- Mining rate limiting and updated minimum block difficulty for RSK Testnet (#1615, #1671)

You can find a complete list of the changes introduced in [Iris 3.2.0 milestone](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/milestone/27).

### New Assets
No new assets were added.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.8.2.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.8.2-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.8.2.jar.txt file.

There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.8.2.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 15.0.5 and the v1.8.2 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.8.2.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <summary>## Main changes

### Payment expiry can be modified

Invoice default expiry is still 1 week, but can now be modified in the payment options screen.

### Prevent sending more than twice the requested amount

This is to prevent a frustrating scenario for the user where the app will let you overpay more than twice an invoice, even though we know the receiving node will most certainly reject the payment in accordance to BOLT11. (See #232)

    <summary>## API Updates
 * A `PaymentFailed` event is now provided to indicate a payment has failed
   fully. This event is generated either after
   `ChannelManager::abandon_payment` is called for a given payment, or the
   payment times out, and there are no further pending HTLCs for the payment.
   This event should be used to detect payment failure instead of
   `PaymentPathFailed::all_paths_failed`, unless no payment retries occur via
   `ChannelManager::retry_payment` (#1202).
 * Payment secrets are now generated deterministically using material from
   the new `KeysInterface::get_inbound_payment_key_material` (#1177).
 * A `PaymentPathSuccessful` event has been added to ease passing success info
   to a scorer, along with a `Score::payment_path_successful` method to accept
   such info (#1178, #1197).
 * `Score::channel_penalty_msat` has additional arguments describing the
   channel's capacity and the HTLC amount being sent over the channel (#1166).
 * A new log level `Gossip` has been added, which is used for verbose
   information generated during network graph sync. Enabling the
   `max_level_trace` feature or ignoring `Gossip` log entries reduces log
   growth during initial start up from many GiB to several MiB (#1145).
 * The `allow_wallclock_use` feature has been removed in favor of only using
   the `std` and `no-std` features (#1212).
 * `NetworkGraph` can now remove channels that we haven't heard updates for in
   two weeks with `NetworkGraph::remove_stale_channels{,with_time}`. The first
   is called automatically if a `NetGraphMsgHandler` is passed to
   `BackgroundProcessor::start` (#1212).
 * `InvoicePayer::pay_pubkey` was added to enable sending &quot;keysend&quot; payments to
   supported recipients, using the `InvoicePayer` to handle retires (#1160).
 * `user_payment_id` has been removed from `PaymentPurpose`, and
   `ChannelManager::create_inbound_payment{,_for_hash}` (#1180).
 * Updated documentation for several `ChannelManager` functions to remove stale
   references to panics which no longer occur (#1201).
 * The `Score` and `LockableScore` objects have moved into the
   `routing::scoring` module instead of being in the `routing` module (#1166).
 * The `Time` parameter to `ScorerWithTime` is no longer longer exposed,
   instead being fixed based on the `std`/`no-std` feature (#1184).
 * `ChannelDetails::balance_msat` was added to fetch a channel's balance
   without subtracting the reserve values, lining up with on-chain claim amounts
   less on-chain fees (#1203).
 * An explicit `UserConfig::accept_inbound_channels` flag is now provided,
   removing the need to set `min_funding_satoshis` to &gt; 21 million BTC (#1173).
 * Inbound channels that fail to see the funding transaction confirm within
   2016 blocks are automatically force-closed with
   `ClosureReason::FundingTimedOut` (#1083).
 * We now accept a channel_reserve value of 0 from counterparties, as it is
   insecure for our counterparty but not us (#1163).
 * `NetAddress::OnionV2` parsing was removed as version 2 onion services are no
   longer supported in modern Tor (#1204).
 * Generation and signing of anchor outputs is now supported in the
   `KeysInterface`, though no support for them exists in the channel itself (#1176)

## Bug Fixes
 * Fixed a race condition in `InvoicePayer` where paths may be retried after
   the retry count has been exceeded. In this case the
   `Event::PaymentPathFailed::all_paths_failed` field is not a reliable payment
   failure indicator. There was no acceptable alternative indicator,
   `Event::PaymentFailed` as been added to provide one (#1202).
 * Reduced the blocks-before-timeout we expect of outgoing HTLCs before
   refusing to forward. This check was overly strict and resulted in refusing
   to forward som HTLCs to a next hop that had a lower security threshold than
   us (#1119).
 * LDK no longer attempt to update the channel fee for outbound channels when
   we cannot afford the new fee. This could have caused force-closure by our
   channel counterparty (#1054).
 * Fixed several bugs which may have prevented the reliable broadcast of our
   own channel announcements and updates (#1169).
 * Fixed a rare bug which may have resulted in spurious route finding failures
   when using last-hop hints and MPP with large value payments (#1168).
 * `KeysManager::spend_spendable_outputs` no longer adds a change output that
   is below the dust threshold for non-standard change scripts (#1131).
 * Fixed a minor memory leak when attempting to send a payment that fails due
   to an error when updating the `ChannelMonitor` (#1143).
 * Fixed a bug where a `FeeEstimator` that returns values rounded to the next
   sat/vbyte may result in force-closures (#1208).
 * Handle MPP timeout HTLC error codes, instead of considering the recipient to
   have sent an invalid error, removing them from the network graph (#1148)

## Serialization Compatibility
 * All above new events/fields are ignored by prior clients. All above new
   events/fields are not present when reading objects serialized by prior
   versions of the library.
 * Payment secrets are now generated deterministically. This reduces the memory
   footprint for inbound payments, however, newly-generated inbound payments
   using `ChannelManager::create_inbound_payment{,_for_hash}` will not be
   receivable using versions prior to 0.0.104.
   `ChannelManager::create_inbound_payment{,_for_hash}_legacy` are provided for
   backwards compatibility (#1177).
 * `PaymentPurpose::InvoicePayment::user_payment_id` will be 0 when reading
   objects written with 0.0.104 when read by 0.0.103 and previous (#1180).

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.8.0.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.8.0-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.8.0.jar.txt file.

There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.8.0.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 15.0.5 and the v1.8.0 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.8.0.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.14.1-beta"/>
    <summary>This marks the first minor release of the `0.14.x` release cycle! This is primarily a bug fix release that fixes: an issue that would arise with `lnd` nodes older than 2 years in certain circumstances, a fix to ensure we always advertise a consistent of feature bits, and most importantly **a fix to ensure compatibility for new channel opens with the latest versions of c-lightning+eclair**. 

# Database Migrations

There are two database migrations for this version in `lnd` (that were included in 0.14.0): One optimizes the storage structure of HTLCs for faster payments and the other removes old channel state data from closed channels to free up disk space. See the [release notes `v0.14.0-beta`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md) (and [`v0.14.1-beta`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.1.md)) for more information.

NOTE: Compacting the DB is recommended after running the migration to reclaim the freed up space.
# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/master/scripts/keys/guggero.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-guggero-v0.14.1-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.14.1-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-guggero-v0.14.1-beta.sig manifest-v0.14.1-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Wed 24 Nov 2021 11:15:46 PM CET
gpg:                using RSA key F4FC70F07310028424EFC20A8E4256593F177720
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Oliver Gugger &lt;gugger@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
Primary key fingerprint: F4FC 70F0 7310 0284 24EF  C20A 8E42 5659 3F17 7720
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-guggero-v0.14.1-beta.sig.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-guggero-v0.14.1-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-guggero-v0.14.1-beta.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/release.md) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.17.3`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, `watchtowerrpc` and `monitoring`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.14.1-beta
gpg: Signature made Wed 24 Nov 2021 11:04:06 PM CET
gpg:                using RSA key F4FC70F07310028424EFC20A8E4256593F177720
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Oliver Gugger &lt;gugger@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
Primary key fingerprint: F4FC 70F0 7310 0284 24EF  C20A 8E42 5659 3F17 7720
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.14.1-beta /verify-install.sh v0.14.1-beta
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.14.1-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.14.1-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.14.1-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.14.1-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

    <summary># Note
`lnd` 0.14.0 has a known issue regarding channel negotiation (e.g. opening channels) with other Lightning implementations. Please upgrade to `lnd` 0.14.1 which mitigates this issue.

# Database Migrations

There are two database migrations for this version in `lnd`: One optimizes the storage structure of HTLCs for faster payments and the other removes old channel state data from closed channels to free up disk space. See the [release notes](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md) for more information.

NOTE: Compacting the DB is recommended after running the migration to reclaim the freed up space.

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.14.0-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.14.0-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.14.0-beta.sig manifest-v0.14.0-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Wed Nov 17 13:20:26 2021 PST

gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

    <summary>Umbrel 0.4.8 brings a new security feature — unique cryptographically secure default app passwords derived from your 24 secret words. This will help protect your Umbrel even if an app's unique Tor URL gets leaked and you have not changed that app's default password.

If you have currently installed ThunderHub, Lightning Terminal, Ride The Lightning, Squeaknode or Code Server on your Umbrel, their default passwords will automatically upgrade to the newer, more secure passwords which can be found on their app store listing pages. In case you have already updated passwords of these apps manually, you can continue to use the same.</summary>

    <summary>This version of Umbrel brings LND 0.13.4 and updated apps (BTCPay Server, Specter Desktop, Pi-hole, Lightning Terminal, and more) to the Umbrel App Store.

LND 0.13.4 fixes a bug discovered in the previous version which will break Neutrino functionality after the Taproot activation in ~3 days. Because Neutrino is only used when Bitcoin Core is still syncing, in short: if Bitcoin Core on your Umbrel hasn't finished syncing, please update immediately. If Bitcoin Core on your Umbrel is 100% synced already, you remain unaffected by this bug and can update at your convenience.</summary>

    <summary>This is a small patch release [that fixes a Taproot related bug for Neutrino](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino/pull/234). If you run neutrino in production, we _strongly_ recommend you update to this version before Taproot activation to ensure your node keeps moving forward in the chain. 

This release only contains a single commit on top of the prior 0.13.3 minor release: https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/compare/0-13-3-branch...0-13-4-branch?expand=1

# Database Migrations

This release does not contain any database migrations.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.4-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.13.4-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.4-beta.sig manifest-v0.13.4-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Wed Sep 30 17:35:20 2020 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 4AB7F8DA6FAEBB3B70B1F903BC13F65E2DC84465
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.4-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.4-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.4-beta.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.16.3`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, `watchtowerrpc` and `monitoring`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.13.4-beta
gpg: Signature made Tue Sep 15 18:55:00 2020 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 4AB7F8DA6FAEBB3B70B1F903BC13F65E2DC84465
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.13.4-beta /verify-install.sh v0.13.4-beta
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.13.4-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.13.4-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.4-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

⚡️⚡️⚡️ OK, now to the rest of the release notes! ⚡️⚡️⚡️

    <summary>We're pleased to announce the 0.10.2 release of c-lightning, named by @vincenzopalazzo.

This is a recommended upgrade: this release includes the patch for the recently disclosed [CVE-2021-41592][cve].

[cve]: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41592

## Highlights for Users

 - Payments can now be retried without affecting the status of prior attempts.
 - The route selection will now use the log-propability-based channel selection to increase success rate and reduce time to completion.
 - `close` now reports the feeranges each side enforced, which allows users to determine which side caused a high or low feerate.
 - Removal of old HTLC information and vacuuming shrinks large lightningd.sqlite3 by a factor of 2-3.

# Highlights for the Network

 - `setchannelfee` now has a grace period during which both old and new fee policies are considered. This prevents a fee update from making the channel unusable until the update propagated.
 - We now perform quick-close if the peer supports it.
 - We send regular pings to detect dead connections (particularly for Tor).
 - Errors returning a channel_update no longer return an outdated one.
 - Anchor output mutual close allow a fee higher than the final commitment transaction
 
# Highlights for Developers

 - Plugins now are notified about an upcoming shutdown, allowing them to store data and clean up before exiting.
 - The datastore API (`datastore`, `deldatastore`, and `listdatastore`) exposes a simple key-value store, allowing plugin authors to store data in the c-lightning database.
 - `ping` now only works if we have a channel with the peer.
 - Relaxed the sqlite3 version match requirements to be at least a minimum version and a major version match

More details can be found in the changelog.

Thanks to everyone for their contributions and bug reports; please keep them coming.

Since 0.10.1, we've had 333 commits from 19 different authors over 85 days.

A special thanks goes to the 4 first time contributors:

 - Dustin Dettmer
 - Michael Folkson

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/releases/tag/v0.0.103"/>
    <summary>## API Updates
 * This release is almost entirely focused on a new API in the
   `lightning-invoice` crate - the `InvoicePayer`. `InvoicePayer` is a
   struct which takes a reference to a `ChannelManager` and a `Router`
   and retries payments as paths fail. It limits retries to a configurable
   number, but is not serialized to disk and may retry additional times across
   a serialization/load. In order to learn about failed payments, it must
   receive `Event`s directly from the `ChannelManager`, wrapping a
   user-provided `EventHandler` which it provides all unhandled events to
   (#1059).
 * `get_route` has been renamed `find_route` (#1059) and now takes a
   `RouteParameters` struct in replacement of a number of its long list of
   arguments (#1134). The `Payee` in the `RouteParameters` is stored in the
   `Route` object returned and provided in the `RouteParameters` contained in
   `Event::PaymentPathFailed` (#1059).
 * `ChannelMonitor`s must now be persisted after calls that provide new block
   data, prior to `MonitorEvent`s being passed back to `ChannelManager` for
   processing. If you are using a `ChainMonitor` this is handled for you.
   The `Persist` API has been updated to `Option`ally take the
   `ChannelMonitorUpdate` as persistence events that result from chain data no
   longer have a corresponding update (#1108).
 * `routing::Score` now has a `payment_path_failed` method which it can use to
   learn which channels often fail payments. It is automatically called by
   `InvoicePayer` for failed payment paths (#1144).
 * The default `Scorer` implementation is now a type alias to a type generic
   across different clocks and supports serialization to persist scoring data
   across restarts (#1146).
 * `Event::PaymentSent` now includes the full fee which was spent across all
   payment paths which were fulfilled or pending when the payment was fulfilled
   (#1142).
 * `Event::PaymentSent` and `Event::PaymentPathFailed` now include the
   `PaymentId` which matches the `PaymentId` returned from
   `ChannelManager::send_payment` or `InvoicePayer::pay_invoice` (#1059).
 * `NetGraphMsgHandler` now takes a `Deref` to the `NetworkGraph`, allowing for
   shared references to the graph data to make serialization and references to
   the graph data in the `InvoicePayer`'s `Router` simpler (#1149).
 * `routing::Score::channel_penalty_msat` has been updated to provide the
   `NodeId` of both the source and destination nodes of a channel (#1133).

## Bug Fixes
 * Previous versions would often disconnect peers during initial graph sync due
   to ping timeouts while processing large numbers of gossip messages. We now
   delay disconnecting peers if we receive messages from them even if it takes
   a while to receive a pong from them. Further, we avoid sending too many
   gossip messages between pings to ensure we should always receive pongs in a
   timely manner (#1137).
 * If a payment was sent, creating an outbound HTLC and sending it to our
   counterparty (implying the `ChannelMonitor` was persisted on disk), but the
   `ChannelManager` was not persisted prior to shutdown/crash, no
   `Event::PaymentPathFailed` event was generated if the HTLC was eventually
   failed on chain. Events are now consistent irrespective of `ChannelManager`
   persistence or non-persistence (#1104).

## Serialization Compatibility
 * All above new Events/fields are ignored by prior clients. All above new
   Events/fields are not present when reading objects serialized by prior
   versions of the library.
 * Payments for which a `Route` was generated using a previous version or for
   which the payment was originally sent by a previous version of the library
   will not be retried by an `InvoicePayer`.

    <summary># Summary

This release contains an important stability upgrade on Tor. Some of our users encountered network instability like delays on Tor so it is recommended to upgrade your client to this version. In addition, there were some minor bug fixes as well. Make sure your Tor client is not running in the background so Wasabi can update it - the easiest way is to restart your machine and start the new version of Wasabi. 

- Updated Tor client to [0.4.5.10](https://blog.torproject.org/node/2062).

# Newbie Guide

While setting up Wasabi is straightforward, even a Linux wizard with the longest beard can get stuck on the most basic tasks. Consider taking a look at the [Installation Instructions](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/InstallPackage.html) guide.

# Advanced Guide

If you want to build Wasabi from source code or update the source code check out [these instructions.](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/BuildSource.html)

From version 1.1.3 Wasabi also introduces [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/): [Deterministic Build Guide](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/Guides/DeterministicBuildGuide.md)

Build with .NET Core 3.1.407-win-x64.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.7.4.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.7.4-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.7.4.jar.txt file.

There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.7.4.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 11.0.10 and the v1.7.4 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.7.4.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/releases/tag/v0.0.102"/>
    <summary>## API Updates
 * `get_route` now takes a `Score` as an argument. `Score` is queried during
   the route-finding process, returning the absolute amounts which you are
   willing to pay to avoid routing over a given channel. As a default, a
   `Scorer` is provided which returns a constant amount, with a suggested
   default of 500 msat. This translates to a willingness to pay up to 500 msat
   in additional fees per hop in order to avoid additional hops (#1124).
 * `Event::PaymentPathFailed` now contains a `short_channel_id` field which may
   be filled in with a channel that can be &quot;blamed&quot; for the payment failure.
   Payment retries should likely avoid the given channel for some time (#1077).
 * `PublicKey`s in `NetworkGraph` have been replaced with a `NodeId` struct
   which contains only a simple `[u8; 33]`, substantially improving
   `NetworkGraph` deserialization performance (#1107).
 * `ChainMonitor`'s `HashMap` of `ChannelMonitor`s is now private, exposed via
   `Chainmonitor::get_monitor` and `ChainMonitor::list_monitors` instead
   (#1112).
 * When an outbound channel is closed prior to the broadcasting of its funding
   transaction, but after you call
   `ChannelManager::funding_transaction_generated`, a new event type,
   `Event::DiscardFunding`, is generated, informing you the transaction was not
   broadcasted and that you can spend the same inputs again elsewhere (#1098).
 * `ChannelManager::create_channel` now returns the temporary channel ID which
   may later appear in `Event::ChannelClosed` or `ChannelDetails` prior to the
   channel being funded (#1121).
 * `Event::PaymentSent` now contains the payment hash as well as the payment
   preimage (#1062).
 * `ReadOnlyNetworkGraph::get_addresses` now returns owned `NetAddress` rather
   than references. As a side-effect this method is now exposed in foreign
   language bindings (#1115).
 * The `Persist` and `ChannelMonitorUpdateErr` types have moved to the
   `lightning::chain::chainmonitor` and `lightning::chain` modules,
   respectively (#1112).
 * `ChannelManager::send_payment` now returns a `PaymentId` which identifies a
   payment (whether MPP or not) and can be used to retry the full payment or
   MPP parts through `retry_payment` (#1096). Note that doing so is currently
   *not* crash safe, and you may find yourself sending twice. It is recommended
   that you *not* use the `retry_payment` API until the next release.

## Bug Fixes
 * Due to an earlier fix for the Lightning dust inflation vulnerability tracked
   in CVE-2021-41591/CVE-2021-41592/CVE-2021-41593 in 0.0.100, we required
   counterparties to accept a dust limit slightly lower than the dust limit now
   required by other implementations. This appeared as, at least, latest lnd
   always refusing to accept channels opened by LDK clients (#1065).
 * If there are multiple channels available to the same counterparty,
   `get_route` would only consider the channel listed last as available for
   sending (#1100).
 * `Persist` implementations returning
   `ChannelMonitorUpdateErr::TemporaryFailure` from `watch_channel` previously
   resulted in the `ChannelMonitor` not being stored at all, resulting in a
   panic after monitor updating is complete (#1112).
 * If payments are pending awaiting forwarding at startup, an
   `Event::PendingHTLCsForwardable` event will always be provided. This ensures
   user code calls `ChannelManager::process_pending_htlc_fowards` even if it
   shut down while awaiting the batching timer during the previous run (#1076).
 * If a call to `ChannelManager::send_payment` failed due to lack of
   availability of funds locally, LDK would store the payment as pending
   forever, with no ability to retry or fail it, leaking memory (#1109).

## Serialization Compatibility
 * All above new Events/fields are ignored by prior clients. All above new
   Events/fields, except for `Event::PaymentSent::payment_hash` are not present
   when reading objects serialized by prior versions of the library.

## Running Bitcoin-S

If you want to run the standalone server binary, after verifying gpg signatures, you
can `unzip bitcoin-s-server-1.8.0.zip` and then run it with `./bin/bitcoin-s-server` to start the node. You will need to
configure the node properly first, you can find example
configurations [here](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/config/configuration#example-configuration-file).

You can then unzip the `bitcoin-s-cli-1.8.0.zip` folder and start using the `bitcoin-s-cli` like this:

```bashrc
./bin/bitcoin-s-cli --help
Usage: bitcoin-s-cli [options] [&lt;cmd&gt;]

  -n, --network &lt;value&gt;    Select the active network.
  --debug                  Print debugging information
  --rpcport &lt;value&gt;        The port to send our rpc request to on the server
  -h, --help               Display this help message and exit
```

For more information on what commands `bitcoin-s-cli` supports check the documentation, here is where to
start: https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/applications/server#server-endpoints

## Verifying signatures

This release is signed with [Chris's signing key](https://bitcoin-s.org/docs/next/security#disclosure) with
fingerprint `339A49229576050819083EB3F99724872F822910`

To do the verification, first hash the executable using `sha256sum`. You should check that the result is listed in
the `SHA256SUMS.asc` file next to its file name. After doing that you can use `gpg --verify` to authenticate the
signature.

Example:

```
$ sha256sum bitcoin-s-server-1.8.0.zip
9c130e51c0ca60021021ea48fab9fa2eae3797bafb1a4c022b3a2cd6d17446a0  bitcoin-s-server-1.8.0.zip
$ sha256sum bitcoin-s-cli-1.8.0.zip

# Executive Summary

This release integrates Tor network support for opening a DLC with your counterparty.
This is a huge UX improvement over the previous flow where 2 _manual_ round trips
were required to open a DLC with your peer.

See individual module sections for updates on per module basis.

## app commons 

Most changes in app commons this release is related to refactoring code so that
it can be used more generically across the code base.

4f7b6422ea 2021 08 06 app config refacotr (#3498)

## App server

The app server is the headless backend for bitcoin-s. This runs our wallet, node
and chain management modules.

The biggest change this release is integrating end to end automated negotiation for entering
into DLCs in PR #3462. This means you can just give your tor address and an offer to a peer
and they will be able to enter into a DLC with you automatically.

This release included deprecating old endpoints that were poorly named and renaming them
to have an announcement suffix. For instance `createenumevent` -&gt; `createenumannouncement`.

The old endpoints will be removed next release. For more information see #3703 .

New rpcs added this release are 

- `getversion` - returns versions of bitcoin-s
- `backupwallet` - backs up the wallet to the provided destination
- `createcontractinfo` - creates a contract info based on oracle, total collateral and payouts
- `decodeoffer` - decodes a dlc offer
- `decodeannouncement` - decodes an oracle announcement
- `decodeattestments` - decodes oracle's attestments

## bitcoind rpc

The major changes this module breaking up `BitcoindInstance` 
to `BitcoindInstanceLocal` and `BitcoindInstanceRemote`. These require different
parameters. We can do much more with a locally running bitcoind instance.

We also can now fetch the version of a running bitcoind instance.

## Build 

We now publish docker images that are available on arm64 as well as amd64.

We also allow docker containers to take a `BITCOIN_S_KEYMANAGER_ENTROPY`.
This is useful for platforms like umbrel that allow external entropy to be
provided by the platform. See #3679 for more information.

9aa9a424c2 Implement init message from BOLT 1 (#3407)

## Db commons 

The release for db commons adds a new class `MasterXPubDAO` that allows you to store the
master xpub for a specific module like the `wallet` or `dlcOracle`. If a different 
seed is used on statup, an exception will be thrown saying that the stored master xpub
and the xpub generated from the seed are different. 

6df0354a73 Enable WAL mode for SQLite (#3704)

48213d9b81 Implement MasterXPubDAO (#3451)


## DLC node

This is a new module. This implements the networking logic to negotiate the building
of Contract Execution Transactions (CET) and the funding transaction for a DLC.

1051e6365a DLC P2P Client (#3402)

## DLC Oracle

This release for DLC oracle focuses on making sure our `DLCOracle` construction is safe.
Previously we could seed the oracle with entropy that doesn't correspond to entropy on disk
or passed via the `BITCOIN_S_KEYMANAGER_ENTROPY` flag.

One other bug fix in this release is making sure we increment the keyIndex in a thread safe way.

## fee provider

BitGo removed some objects from the result they return from their API

3ffa997cc7 remove fields from BitGoResult (#3739)

## gui 

Tons of improvements to the GUI. Our thinking on the GUI is to re-write it in typescript.
We will continue to support for the desktop GUI for now, will the goal of phasing it out
over the long term.

## Oracle explorer client

Updates the API used by oracle explorer client to be `v2`. Suredbits
released this API recently. [See the API docs for more info](https://gist.github.com/Christewart/a9e55d9ba582ac9a5ceffa96db9d7e1f)

ab8649a6a1 update oracle explorer client to use v2 of the API (#3747)

## Oracle server

This release adds two new endpoint for the oracle server in #3701

**_WARNING_**

These endpoints should be used VERY carefully. You can reveal your private key if you delete
attestations that were widely shared if you re-attest with a different value. Deleting
an announcement that users have built DLCs based on will mean those DLCs will have to exercise
the refund clause. If you don't know what you are doing, it's best to not use these endpoints.

- `deleteannouncement` - deletes the announcement
- `deleteattestation` - deletes the attestations for an announcement

6aff01ffbf createattesattion -&gt; signenum (#3712)

3d725adc92 2021 09 29 delete announcement (#3701)

## testkit

The major new feature this release is adding the ability to configure the testkit to use
postgres with the test harness. You can force the testkit by setting this configuration
in your reference.conf `bitcoin-s.testkit.pg.enabled=true`

    <summary># Eclair v0.6.2

This releases fixes a known vulnerability, makes several performance improvements, includes a few bug fixes and many new features.
It is fully compatible with 0.6.1 (and all previous versions of eclair).

This release requires a few actions from node operators when upgrading: make sure you read the release notes carefully!

The release notes can be found [here](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/blob/master/docs/release-notes/eclair-v0.6.2.md).

## Verifying signatures

You will need `gpg` and our release signing key 7A73FE77DE2C4027. Note that you can get it:

- from our website: https://acinq.co/pgp/drouinf.asc
- from github user @sstone, a committer on eclair: https://api.github.com/users/sstone/gpg_keys

To import our signing key:

```sh
$ gpg --import drouinf.asc
```

To verify the release file checksums and signatures:

```sh
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped
```

## Building

Eclair builds are deterministic. To reproduce our builds, please use the following environment (*):

- Ubuntu 20.04
- AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.6
- Maven 3.8.1

Use the following command to generate the eclair-node package:

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

That should generate `eclair-node/target/eclair-node-0.6.2-6817d6f-bin.zip` with sha256 checksums that match the one we provide and sign in `SHA256SUMS.asc`

(*) You may be able to build the exact same artefacts with other operating systems or versions of JDK 11, we have not tried everything.

## Upgrading

This release is fully compatible with previous eclair versions. You don't need to close your channels, just stop eclair, upgrade and restart.</summary>

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.13.3-beta"/>
    <summary># Security Fixes

This release contains a security fix for [CVE-2021-41593](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41593) which would allow an attacker to cause loss of funds through a griefing vector related to high accepted dust values. This release addresses the issue by enforcing stricter clamps on accepted dust values during channel funding, and also adds `hltcswitch` level dust accounting to limit the total dust exposure (triggered by an instantaneous force close) at any moment. The default allotted fully forwarded dust exposure level is set at `500k sats`, this value can be tweaked with a new config flag: `--dust-threshold=`. 

If upgrading is not possible to prevent CVE-2021-41593, the [`dust-tool`](https://github.com/lightninglabs/dust-tool) can intercept bad `open_channel` parameters and reject them via our `ChannelAcceptor`. In addition, it can also scan your node's current set of confirmed channels and recommend closing potentially risky ones out.

Alternatively, your node's advertised `min_htlc` value can be increased to ensure it is well above all the dust limits of its active channels. 

# Database Migrations
This release does not contain any database migrations.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already: 

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.13.3-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.sig manifest-v0.13.3-beta.txt
```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Mon Oct  4 08:20:20 2021 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Olaoluwa Osuntokun &lt;laolu32@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [ultimate]

```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 &lt;filename&gt;`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp 

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the _git tag_ with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts: ` manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands: 
```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.sig
```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally. 

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires. 

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.
The release binaries are compiled with `go1.16.3`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.
They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, `watchtowerrpc` and `monitoring`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=&lt;OS-ARCH&gt; tag=&lt;tag&gt;` can be used. 

Finally, you can also verify the _tag_ itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.13.3-beta
gpg: Signature made Mo 04 Okt 2021 16:08:05 CEST
gpg:                using RSA key F4FC70F07310028424EFC20A8E4256593F177720
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Oliver Gugger &lt;gugger@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [unknown]
```

## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```shell
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=&quot;&quot; lightninglabs/lnd:v0.13.3-beta /verify-install.sh v0.13.3-beta
$ OK=$?
$ if [ &quot;$OK&quot; -ne &quot;0&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Verification failed!&quot;; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```

# Building the Contained Release 

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming
that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.13.3-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.13.3-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.3-beta&quot; ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags &quot;-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.3-beta&quot; ./cmd/lncli
```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory. 

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a _specific_ system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191): 

```
make release sys=&quot;linux-arm64 darwin-amd64&quot;
```

### New Assets
No new assets were added.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.7.4.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.7.4-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.7.4.jar.txt file.

There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.7.4.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 11.0.10 and the v1.7.4 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.7.4.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.

    <link href="https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/releases/tag/v0.0.101"/>
    <summary>## API Updates
 * Custom message types are now supported directly in the `PeerManager`,
   allowing you to send and receive messages of any type that is not natively
   understood by LDK. This requires a new type bound on `PeerManager`, a
   `CustomMessageHandler`. `IgnoringMessageHandler` provides a simple default
   for this new bound for ignoring unknown messages (#1031, #1074).
 * Route graph updates as a result of failed payments are no longer provided as
   `MessageSendEvent::PaymentFailureNetworkUpdate` but instead included in a
   new field in the `Event::PaymentFailed` events. Generally, this means route
   graph updates are no longer handled as a part of the `PeerManager` but
   instead through the new `EventHandler` implementation for
   `NetGraphMsgHandler`. To make this easy, a new parameter to
   `lightning-background-processor::BackgroundProcessor::start` is added, which
   contains an `Option`al `NetGraphmsgHandler`. If provided as `Some`, relevant
   events will be processed by the `NetGraphMsgHandler` prior to normal event
   handling (#1043).
 * `NetworkGraph` is now, itself, thread-safe. Accordingly, most functions now
   take `&amp;self` instead of `&amp;mut self` and the graph data can be accessed
   through `NetworkGraph.read_only` (#1043).
 * The balances available on-chain to claim after a channel has been closed are
   now exposed via `ChannelMonitor::get_claimable_balances` and
   `ChainMonitor::get_claimable_balances`. The second can be used to get
   information about all closed channels which still have on-chain balances
   associated with them. See enum variants of `ln::channelmonitor::Balance` and
   method documentation for the above methods for more information on the types
   of balances exposed (#1034).
 * When one HTLC of a multi-path payment fails, the new field `all_paths_failed`
   in `Event::PaymentFailed` is set to `false`. This implies that the payment
   has not failed, but only one part. Payment resolution is only indicated by an
   `Event::PaymentSent` event or an `Event::PaymentFailed` with
   `all_paths_failed` set to `true`, which is also set for the last remaining
   part of a multi-path payment (#1053).
 * To better capture the context described above, `Event::PaymentFailed` has
   been renamed to `Event::PaymentPathFailed` (#1084).
 * A new event, `ChannelClosed`, is provided by `ChannelManager` when a channel
   is closed, including a reason and error message (if relevant, #997).
 * `lightning-invoice` now considers invoices with sub-millisatoshi precision
   to be invalid, and requires millisatoshi values during construction (thus
   you must call `amount_milli_satoshis` instead of `amount_pico_btc`, #1057).
 * The `BaseSign` interface now includes two new hooks which provide additional
   information about commitment transaction signatures and revocation secrets
   provided by our counterparty, allowing additional verification (#1039).
 * The `BaseSign` interface now includes additional information for cooperative
   close transactions, making it easier for a signer to verify requests (#1064).
 * `Route` has two additional helper methods to get fees and amounts (#1063).
 * `Txid` and `Transaction` objects can now be deserialized from responses when
   using the HTTP client in the `lightning-block-sync` crate (#1037, #1061).

## Bug Fixes
 * Fix a panic when reading a lightning invoice with a non-recoverable
   signature. Further, restrict lightning invoice parsing to require payment
   secrets and better handle a few edge cases as required by BOLT 11 (#1057).
 * Fix a panic when receiving multiple messages (such as HTLC fulfill messages)
   after a call to `chain::Watch::update_channel` returned
   `Err(ChannelMonitorUpdateErr::TemporaryFailure)` with no
   `ChannelManager::channel_monitor_updated` call in between (#1066).
 * For multi-path payments, `Event::PaymentSent` is no longer generated
   multiple times, once for each independent part (#1053).
 * Multi-hop route hints in invoices are now considered in the default router
   provided via `get_route` (#1040).
 * The time peers have to respond to pings has been increased when building
   with debug assertions enabled. This avoids peer disconnections on slow hosts
   when running in debug mode (#1051).
 * The timeout for the first byte of a response for requests from the
   `lightning-block-sync` crate has been increased to 300 seconds to better
   handle the long hangs in Bitcoin Core when it syncs to disk (#1090).

## Serialization Compatibility
 * Due to a bug in 0.0.100, `Event`s written by 0.0.101 which are of a type not
   understood by 0.0.100 may lead to `Err(DecodeError::InvalidValue)` or corrupt
   deserialized objects in 0.100. Such `Event`s will lead to an
   `Err(DecodeError::InvalidValue)` in versions prior to 0.0.100. The only such
   new event written by 0.0.101 is `Event::ChannelClosed` (#1087).
 * Payments that were initiated in versions prior to 0.0.101 may still
   generate duplicate `PaymentSent` `Event`s or may have spurious values for
   `Event::PaymentPathFailed::all_paths_failed` (#1053).
 * The return values of `ChannelMonitor::get_claimable_balances` (and, thus,
   `ChainMonitor::get_claimable_balances`) may be spurious for channels where
   the spend of the funding transaction appeared on chain while running a
   version prior to 0.0.101. `Balance` information should only be relied upon
   for channels that were closed while running 0.0.101+ (#1034).
 * Payments failed while running versions prior to 0.0.101 will never have a
   `Some` for the `network_update` field (#1043).

- [Allow LTC accounts to use SegWit addresses](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5639)

### Bug fixes
- [Fix issue with extraData field when editing offer](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5651)
- [Fix issue for deprecated payment account imported from backup](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5644)
- [Prevent negative suggested mining fee when burning BSQ for fees](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/5643)

### New Assets
No new assets were added.

## Verification

For a detailed description on how to verify your Bisq installer please have a look at our wiki: https://bisq.wiki/Downloading_and_installing#Verify_installer_file

Url of the signing key (Christoph Atteneder): https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc
Full fingerprint: `CB36 D7D2 EBB2 E35D 9B75  500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B`

Import the key:
`curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import`
GPG prints a confusion warning: &quot;This key is not certified with a trusted signature!&quot; - See https://serverfault.com/questions/569911/how-to-verify-an-imported-gpg-key for background information what it means.

How to verify signatures?
`gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify BINARY{.asc*,}`
Replace BINARY with the file you downloaded (e.g. Bisq-1.7.3.dmg)

Verify jar file inside binary:
You can verify on OSX the jar file with:
shasum -a256 [PATH TO BISQ APP]/Bisq.app/Contents/app/desktop-1.7.3-all.jar
The output need to match the value from the Bisq-1.7.3.jar.txt file.

*NEW: There are three hashes within the Bisq-1.7.3.jar.txt file (macOS, Windows, Linux).
If you want to reproduce and verify the hash of the jar file locally, you need to do so on Windows or Linux using Java 11.0.10 and the v1.7.3 release tag. Because of the signing and notarization process that requires the developer certificate used for the build on macOS it is not possible to create the same jar on macOS.*

## Known issues with installation 

### Windows:

There is a known issue with Anti Virus software. We got several reports from users running into different problems. Either the AV software blocks Bisq or Tor, delete files in the data directory [2] or app directory [1]) or cause such a long delay at startup that Tor gets terminated and a file remains locked which can cause that Bisq cannot be started afterwards. To resolve that you need to restart Windows then the lock get released. We are working on solutions to fix those issues.

If you use Crypto currencies on your Windows system be aware that Windows is much more vulnerable to malware than Linux or OSX. Consider to use a dedicated non-Windows system when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

[1] Application directory (contains application installation files):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Bisq

[2] Data directory (contains all Bisq data including wallet):
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bisq\btc_mainnet\tor (you can delete everything except the hiddenservice directory)


### Linux:

Hint for Debian users:
If you have problems starting Bisq on Debian use: `/opt/bisq/bin/Bisq`

If your Linux distro does not support .deb files please follow this instruction:
```
cd ~/Downloads  
mkdir tmp  
cd tmp   
ar x ../Bisq-64bit-1.7.3.deb  
sudo tar Jxvf data.tar.xz  
sudo cp -rp opt/Bisq /opt/
```
That instruction is not tested on many different distros. If you encounter problems please report it in a Github issue so we can improve it.
